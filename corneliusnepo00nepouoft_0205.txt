still more to add a relish to their sood. Some of these articles were
taken from the vegetable kingdom, but were much more pungent and
savory than bread‚ such as olives, either fresh or pickled, radishes,
’ and sesamum. Of animal sood‚ by much the most common kind was
fish, aud, more especially, salt fish, which was most extensively em-
ployed to give a relish to the vegetable diet, either at breakfast or
the principal meai. Os the different parts osfishes, the roe was the
most esteemed for this purpose. It is still prepared, at the present
day, from the very same waters adjoining Myus, that were given
by the King of Persia to Themistocles. (Dice. Am, s. υ.)

Prope oppidum. “Near the city (os Athens).” Oppidum is here
equivalent to Athenas. Consult note on Vz't. Mile„ chapter iv., ᾧ 2,
Α tomb, called that of Themistocles, existed as late as the time os
Pausanias the geographer (who flourished during the reigns of Ha-

and privileges were granted also by the Magnesiaus to the deseend-
ants of Themistocles.

this story os his having put an end to his lise by poison. That sear
of disappointing the Persian king should have urged him to such an
act is indeed scarcely credible. Yet we can easily conceive that
the man who had been kept awake by the trophies of Miltiades,
must have felt some bitter pangs when he heard os the rising glory

LIFE AND WRI'PINGS OF ΝΕΡΘΒ.1

 

CORNELIUS NEPOS was the contemporary and friend of
Cicero, Atticus, and Catullus. He was a native probably
of Hostilia, now Ostiglz'a, a small town of Gallia Cispa-
dana, on the Po, to the southeast of Verona, and between
this latter place and Mutina, now Ilffodena. He died dui-
ing the reign of Augustus. No other particulars with re-
gard to his personal history have been transmitted to us.
He is known, however, to have written the following pieces,
all of which are now lost:

1. Chronica. An Epitome of Universal History, it
would appear, in three books. For the name and some
idea of the contents we are indebted to⁴Ausonius² and Soli-
nus 33 while Catullus, when dedicating his poems to Nepos,
indicates, though obscurely, the object and extent of the
productiori in question. “

2. Exemplorum Libri, of which Charisius⁴ quotes the
second book, and Aulus Gellius the fifth.⁵ This was prob-
ably a collection of remarkable sayings and doings, of the
same description as the compilation subsequently formed by
Valerius Maximus.

3. De Viris Illustribzcs. Gelliusss relates an anecdote
of Cato taken from this work. It is not impossible, how-
ever, that it may be the same work as the preceding,
quoted under a different title.

4. Vita Ciceronis, an error in which is corrected by
Aulus Gellius.⁷

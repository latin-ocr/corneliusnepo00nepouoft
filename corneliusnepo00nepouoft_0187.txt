with it in such cases the idea os some difficulty or other that is to
be melcoma—Ancipiti periculo. “By a double danger,'' i. a, an
attack in sront and rear at the same time. Literally‚ “by a two
headed (i. e., double fronted) danger.'' Anceps is from am and caput.
Bremi calls attention to the employmcnt os periculo so soon aster
periculum, as indicating carelessness on the part of our author. Sim—
ilar instances‚ however, occur, not only in Nepos, but even in the

Quo sactum est, ut. “ By which means it came to pass, that.”—
Exadversum. “Over against.” The more usual form of expres

The Athenians called their city ᾰστυ, just as the Romans called
theirs Urbs, and Nepos here follows his Grecian authorities closely
by employing their very term. As regards the construction of ac-
cessit, observe that it takes the accusative with or without ad, or
else the dative. It takes the accusative with ad when a thing or
person is actually reached3 the accusative without ad (as in the
present instance), when the place or person is not immediately
reached ; and the dative, when the place or person is more remote.
(Bromi, ad leemist.² vii, 2.)—Nullis defendentibus. This statement,
as already remarked (note on chapter ii.‚ ᾧ 8), is historically incor-
rect. The city itself was not defended, but the Acropolis was
The garrison, however, was only a small band, and, though they
made a vigorous resistance, were finally overpowered.—Intcrsoelis
sacerdotibus. When two clauses containing ablatives absolute suc-

one and the same time, the conjunctive cc is omitted. As regards
the expression sacerdotibus, consult note on chapter ii.‚ 9 8.

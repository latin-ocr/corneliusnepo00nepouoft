Praefecti. “ Commanders.'’ Datis and Artaphernes.—Classe ad
Euboeam appulsa, “Their fleet having sailed to Euboea.'’ More
literally, “ having been impelled or urged onward to Euboea.’‘ The
expression appellere: navem ad terram means properly “to impel οι·
urge on a vessel to the land,” and hence, more freely, “ to sail to,”
or, if the place is a port, “ to put into,'’ and the place to which is ex-
pressed either with or without a preposition. In later writers, ap-

in the AEgean Sea, lying off the coasts of Attica and Boeotia, and

refers back to Eretriam, and not, as some think, to Euboeam, which
last would be historically untrue.—Abrcptos miserunt. Equivalent
to abripuerunt et miserunt. Herodotus, however, says that Datis
and Artaphernes brought away the Eretrian captives in their fleet,
after the battle of Marathon, and led thern up to the king at Susa.
Darius treated them with clemency, and gave them a settlemeut in
the Cissian territory.

Atticam. Attica was the most celebrated country in all Greece.
It lay to the south of Boeotia. Its capital was Athens—Suos copias

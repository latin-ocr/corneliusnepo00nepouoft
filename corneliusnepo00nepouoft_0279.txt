nng subsequently to withdraw Ionia and AEolis from the Persian
seeptre, and transfer them to the rule os Athens, was certainly not
deserving ofthe commendation here bestowed upon it by Nepos, and
was by no means consistent with the character osan honorable man.
There is great reason to believe, however, that the charge was a salse
one, got up to effect his ruin. Compare Diod. Sia, xiv„ 863 Xon„
Hist. Gr.‚ iv., 8, seqq.—Nam quum magnam auctoritatem, &c- ‘⁶ For,
when he had established for himself great influence‚’⁷ i. e.‚ weight of
character.—Dare operam. ‘⁸ To endeavor.''

Dinon hz'storicus. Dinon was the father os Clitarchus, the histo-
rian ofAlexander's expedition. Hc wrote a history os Persia3 and
although Nepos here refers to it as the most trustworthy authority
on the subject, yet, if we may trust Pliny (H. N., x., 49), he had a
large fund of credulity.— Utrum Ἠνῐὸᾶεο sciente, &c “ WVhether it
was done with the knowledge of Tiribazus‚ or without his knowl-
edge.” Xenophon, who relates the imprisonment of Conon, says
nothing ofhis death. Lysias (On the Property of Aristophanes, ᾧ 635,
seqq.) gives an account of Conon's property, which was of consider-
able amount in Cyprus, and states that it was disposed of after his
death; and Mitford has conjectured with good reason that he es-
caped to Cyprus out of the hands osTiribazus‚ and died there (chap-
ter xxv.‚ § 6). The words os Lysias certainly imply that he died a
natural death, and was not murdered. He appears to have died
about B.C. 388.

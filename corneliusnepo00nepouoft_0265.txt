zens by hundreds into exile, and the temper now prevailing at
Thebes encouraged him to undertake the deliverance of his country.
Having obtained a small supply of arms and money from his Theban
friends, he crossed the border with a band os about seventy resu-
gees, and seized on the fortress os Phyle, which stood on an emi-
nence projecting from the side of Mount Parnes, with which it was
connected by a narrow ridge with precipitous sides, twelve or thir·

Pholon. Accusative of Phyle, cs.-—Quod cst castellum, διο. Ac-
cording to the general rule, we should have here quae cst castellum,
&c., but the relative sometimes is made to refer to the explanatory
substantive which follows. (Zumpt, ᾧ 372.) Compare notes on
Vit. Mitt„ chapter iw, ς) 3.—Trigz'nta de suis. The number is dif-

Compare Vit. Alcz‘b„ chapter iv., ᾧ 1.—Quoe res. The small number
of his sollowers.—Rlis . . . . perniciei. The double dative-Et huic

object, whereas despicere implies its relative inseriority. Thus, de-
spicio te is equivalent to contemno tc pra: mc, ‘⁴ 1 think contemptuously
of you, compared with myself.”—-Ad persequendum. “ To look aster

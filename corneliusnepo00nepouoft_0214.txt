viduatis, proportioned to the whole number to be raised, say two
hundred. Each osthese chose sour others, also os noble rank. And
then each of this united body of nobles chose ten targcteers, ten
slingers, and ten archcrs. Nepos expresses this by viritim legerat,
so that legerat has here, in fact, the meaning of ⁴¹ had caused to be
chosen,” and is equivalent to legendos curaverat, or lectos habebat.—
Haud ῑιᾶ magna τηᾰηιι Graeciae. “By a not very numerous army of
Greece,'' ι’. c.‚ not so large as one would have supposed. Observe
the soree of Ιιαιιιί ita. The army was not small in itself. but was
small when compared with the host opposed to it. The whole
strength of the Grecian army was about one hundred and ten thou-
sand--quuc ipse dax cet-{dit proelio. Mardonius fought bravely in
the sront os danger with one thousand picked Persians about him,
but was slain by Aeimnestus or Arimnestus, a Spartan, and his sall

Plurima miscet-e. ‘⁴ To throw very many things into confusion,'’
i. e., to make very great confusion. The verb misceo is very osten
used in the sense of mixing up and throwing into confusion what
was previously settled and well-ordered. Compare Vell. Patere„ ii.,
2, 3, “summa imis miscuit.''—Concupisccrc. “ Eagerly to desire.”
This verb, as Bremi remarks, is employed to indicate an eager de-
sire sor a thing. without regard to what is right and hemming—In
eo est reprehensus. ‘⁴ He was blamed sor this.'’ LiteraIly, “in the
case ofthis.’'—Trz'p5dem aureum. It was not a golden‚ but a brazen
one. The scholiast on Thucydides informs us that it was aster-
ward removed from Delphi to Constantinople‚ and placed in the
Hippodrome there. It still exists in that city, though sadly muti-
atad—Delphis. “At Delphi.'’ Locative case. Consult Vic. Mitt„
chapter i.. ᾧ 2.—I’osuissct. The subjunctive, as conveying the sen-
timents and language os others, not os Nepos. The verb ponere is
here used like the Greek ἀνατιθέναι, to indicate a consecrating os
an offering. The Greeks generally consecrated a portion os the
spoils after a victory to some deity, most commonly Apollo—Epi-
grammata scripto. “An inscription having been written thereon‚”
i. c., having been cut or engraved. The term epigramma is here
employed in its genuine Greek sense—Haec sentencia. ‘⁶ The follow-
ing statement.''—Ej1tsque victoria crgo. ‘¹ And that, on account of
this victory.” Ergo, from the Greek ἔργῳ, occurs but rarely, and
chiefly in carly Judicial language. (Zumpt, ᾧ 679Λ

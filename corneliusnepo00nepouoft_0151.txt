NOTES.

PRAEmrro. In this presace Nepos dedicates his work to Titus
Pomponius Atticus, the well-known friend of Cicero, and who ob-
tained his surname of Atticus from his long residence in Athens,
the capital of Attica, and from his intimate acquaintance with the
language and literature of Greeee. The object of the preface is to
show that the writer ought not to be censured sor intermingling
with the biographies of eminent men of other nations some account
of the manners and customs of those nations themselves.

ᾧ l.

Non dubito, διο. “ Ι do not doubt that there will be a great many,
Ο Atticus,” &e. The expression mm dubito has two meanings‚ “ I
do not doubt‚” and “ Ι do not hesitate.’' The regular construction
is to have mm dubito, “I do not doubt‚” followed by quin with the
subjunctive3 and non dubito, “I do not hesitate,” followed by the
infinitive. Nepos, however, deviates here from regular usage, and
has the infinitive where we would expect to see quin with the sub-
junctive. In later writers this same deviation is frequently found.
(Zumpt, ᾧ 541.)—Fore. For futuros csse—Plerosque. In ordinary
language, plerique only means “ most people,” or ‘⁴ the majority ;''
whereas plurimi signifies both “ most people” and “ a great many.”
All writers, however, do not observe this difference. Nepos often
uses plerique, as on the present occasion, in the sense of “ a great
many.”

Hoc genus scriptam. ‘⁴ This kind of writing,'’ z'. e., this mode of
giving historical sketches ofindividuals, intermingled with allusions
to national manners and customs.—Leve. ‘¹ Trifling in its nature.”

mask'” sor supporting a character on the stage, the ancient actore
all wearing masks ; and then it denotes figuratively a character or
condition in life, a rank or position in society—Quum relatum legent.
“When they shall read it related.’' Relatum is the passive parti-
ciple ofraesero.—Docuerit. Governing two accusatives—Aut in ejus

Quum summa Ιιιιτηᾶπὶεαε, ἀο. “Both the greatest benevolence
of character, and, in particular, wonderful affability.‘' We have
given communitas here as a much better reading than comitas, and
one that harmonizes more with the context. Comitas denotes mere
outward courtesy, which is osten found without any good feeling at
all connected with it. In the construction with quum . . . . tum, a
greater importance is assigned to the second part, and hence we
must enlarge on tamin translating. (Zumpt, ᾧ 723.)-Ραιὲνει. The
subjunctive, because, on account of the tam which precedes, the rel-
ative cui is here equivalent to ut illi. (Zumpt, <> 556.)-Auct‹3r2'tas.
“Influence.’'—Laus rei militaris. ‘⁴ Military reputation.'’ Liter
any, “ praise in respect os the military art.''—Eum {nr-‚axium plecti
‘³ That he ⁴should be punished, though innocent.'’

Alczbiaedes, clinice filiu-³, Atheniensis. These words form a mere
title or inscription sor the biography that follows. Compare notes
on Vit. Themi-st„ chapter i., ᾦ 1.—Qnid efficere possit, &Q “ To have
tried what she can effect.'’ The present, possit, is here employed,
because the remark is intended as a general one, and as an expres-
sion of thought on the part of the writer himself. The imperfect,
posset, on the other hand, would refer merely to the past, and would,
of course, exclude the idea of generality. Compare Zumpt, <5 514.
—Nihil illo fuisse excellentius. ‘¹ That nothing was more pre-eminent
than he.'' Observe here the general meaning of excellentius, de-
noting pre-eminence as well in what is bad as in what is good. Ob-
serve also the employment of nihil instead of neminem, in order to
give more force to the idea intended to be expressed. (Bremi, ad loc.)

nected by birth with the nobles-t samilies of Athens. Through his
father he traced his descent from Eurysaces, the son of Ajax, and
through him from AEacus and Jupiter. His mother, Deinomache,
was the daughter osMegacles, the head of the house of the Alcmaeo-
nidae.—Mulco formosissimus. Alcibiades was at every period of his
lise remarkable sor the extraordinary beauty of his person, os which
he seems to have been exeeedingly vain- Consiliique plenus. “And
abounding in practica] Wisdom.''—Imperalor summus. “ A very dis-
tinguished commander.”-Dzsertus‚ ut. For ita discam, ut.—Im-
primis. “In an especial degree.‘’-—Tanta crac commendatio, &c.
“So powersul was the attraction os his elocution and languagc.’'

is here comprehended every thing relating to externals, namely,
look, gesture, tone os voice, διο», or what wc designate by the gen-

eral term ‘⁶ elocution.“ Κ ἢ

with him.’' Compare note on convenit, chapter viii.‚ ᾧ 3.—Hi prop-
ter notitiam sunt intromissi. “These‚ on account of their being
known to him, were let in.” Notitia properly has an active force,

some securing the doors, others the windows. The assassffls, who
were Zacyntliians, as Nepos also states, entered in their ordinary
dress unarmed. Those who remained without fastenetl the doors.

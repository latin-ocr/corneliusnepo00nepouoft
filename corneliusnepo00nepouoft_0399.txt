ex quo is equivalent here to ut ez e0.—Nemo εἰ in acie, διε. This,
and what follows, is not true. All that can be said of Hannibal is
that he was never defeated in Italy—Cannensem. “ Of Cannae.'’

CHAPTER VI.

Hinc invictus, διο. Hannibal had sor more than fineen years
carried on the war in Italy, laying it waste from one extremity to
the other, and during all this period his superiority in the field had
been uncontested. The Romans calculated that in these fifteen
years their losses in the field alone had amounted to not less than
three hundred thousand men—Patriam defensum revocatus. He was
reealled to make head against Scipio—P. Scipionem. The famous
Scipio Africanus, the son of Publius Scipio. While Hannibal was
carrying on the war in Italy, this general proposed the bold expe-
dient os going with an army into Africa, and attacking Carthage.
The measure was reluctantly acceded to by the senate, but it was
crowned with complete success—Primum apud Rhodanum, διο.

Doederlein conjectures prccscntiarum to be an adjective, derived
srom prce-sentia, like pestilentiarius from pestilencia, an opinion to
which Bremi does not seem disinclined. (Doed., Lat. Syn„ vol. i.,
p. 140. Compare Hand, Turscll.‚ vol. iii., p. 234, seqq.)—In colloqu-
ium convenit. Hannibal went to meet Scipio on the River Bagra-
das, which falls into the Guls os Carthage near Utica—conditio-
· nes non convenerunt. “The conditions were not agreed to.‘' And
yet these conditions were mild in comparison with those which
Carthage was afterward compelled to accept. The solly osthe Car-
thaginian people‚ however, broke off the negotiations‚ sor, as they

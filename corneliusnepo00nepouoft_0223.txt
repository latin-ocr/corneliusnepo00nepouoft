Paucis gradihus. “By a few steps-’'—Quoe Χαλκίοικος vocatur.
“ Who is called Chalcioecus,'’ ε’. c.‚ the goddess of the brazen abode.
A question arises here whether quae refers back to aedem or to Mi-
nervoe. Bremi decides in favor os the former3 but as Nepos evidently
had the text os Thucydides in vievv, and as this latter writer speaks
of the ‘¹ Chalcioecan Minerva,'’ we have preferred adopting the com-
mon mode ostranslating the term. Minerva was called Chalcia-can
because her temple was lined with plates os brass. Compare Thu-
cydides, i., 134.—Valvas obstruxerunt. “ Blocked up the doors.” By
valvoe are commonly meant the leaves of a solding door—Tectum.
‘⁴ The roof.’'—Sub divo. ·‘ In the open air‚” i. e.‚ beneath the canopy
of heaven. By divum is meant “ the open air,'' “the sky.’'

Dicitur eo tempore, &c The persona] construction, namely‚ dicitur

be imitated than the present one. Compare Zumpt, ᾧ 607, note.—
Jam magno natu. “Being now os a great age.“ Natu is an old
ablative‚ and only occurring in this case. (Zumpt, ᾧ 90.)-Ιη primis.
“Among the first,'’ τ’. 6., was one of the first to bring.—Adfilium clau-
dendum. They starved him to death.

,Hic quum semianimi& &c According to Thucydides, when they

llic sacred prccincts, while yet brealhing, and, on being removed,
he immediately expired.

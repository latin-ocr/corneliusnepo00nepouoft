Greek ἄκλητος. So in Livy (xxii, 39) wo have me indicente sor
me non dicente. Compare Drakenborch, ad loc. There was always
in the agorn a large number of the poorer class os citizens, who at-
tached themselves to the wealthy and distinguished, and paid their
court to them, in the expectation of being invited home—Devocaret.
“ He invited home.'’ Devocare is, properly, “to call down,” as is
from a higher place to a lower. So here, down from the agora into
his house—Quod facere nultum diem praetermittebat. Since praeter-
mittebat stands here in construction with nullum diem, we would
naturally expect quin faceret in place of facere. There appears,
however, as Bremi remarks, to be here a blending of two construc-
tions, namely, praetermittebat facere, this verb taking the infinitive
when it has no accusative connected with it, and proetcrmz'ttebat nul-
lum diem.

Fides ejus. “His protection.’' The reference here is properly
to a faithful granting of protection, which he had virtually or ex-
pressly promised to grant. (Bi-emi, ad loc. ; Arnold, ad loc.)— Unde.
“Wherewith.⁹²—Rcliqztisscnt. The subjunctive is here employed,
because the idea is, in fact, so poor that they had not any thing lest.
(Freu71d‚ ad loc.)—Extzzlit. “He caused to be carired forth sor in-
terment.” Equivalent to efferendos curavit.

Sz‘c se gerendo. “By conducting himself thus.‘' Observe here
the ablative absolute of the gerund, which is of frequent occurrence
tn Livy. (Consult Bauer, Cltrcstom. Liv. Iud„ s. v. Ger-und.) It is
distinguished from the parssciple by its referring to what takes place
in many instances, whereas the participle absolute relates merely
to some particular point of time. (Daclinc, ad loc.)—Si et vita, &e
The more usual form of expression would have been quod in place
ossa—Secura. “ An untroubled one‚’⁷ i. e., comparatively free from
cara—Acerba. “ Asslicting,'' i. e., to his sellow—citizens at large.

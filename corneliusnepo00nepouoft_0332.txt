“The use‚'’ i. e„ the purposes.—Belli utilitatem. “Aidvantage iu
war.’'

Exercebatur. “He used to exercise himself.” The passive in a
middle sense, or rather the middle voice itsels. Compare Zumpt,
ᾧ late-Ad cum finem, quoad, διο. “As long as he could standing
grapple and contend (with his adversary).'' Literally, “up to that
end, until he could‚⁷’ διο. The subjunctive is here employed to de-
note a purpose or design. (Madvig, §355.)—Stans. The contest
in wrestling was divided by the ancients into two parts, one the
fight of the athletae as long as they stood upright, and the other in
which they struggled with one another while lying on the ground.
The former was the more usual mode, and is the one here meant.
It was, moreover‚ the one best adapted for purposes of warsare, and

was therefore preferred by Epaminondas.

Firmitacem. “Strength.''—Bona. “Good qualities.’‘—Modcstus.
‘⁸Unassuming.”—Tcmporibus sapienter utens. “Skillfully availing

himself of opportunities.’⁷ Observe here the employment of crat
with the present participle utens to denote a continued habit, whereas
the imperfect utebatur would be confined merely to something going
on at the time. So we have, in what follows,scrcrzs and celans.—
Mamt. ‘⁶ In action.'’ Literally, “ with the hand.''—Anim0 maximo.
“Of very great eourage.''—Diligcns. “Fontis’ The present par-
ticiple active is joined with a genitive when it does not express a
simple act or momentary condition, hut, like the adjective, a per-
manent quality or condition. (Zumpt, (5438.)

Idem continens. “ He was also continent,” i. c.‚ marked by sels-
control, chaste. Supply illesur't. Literally, ‘¹ lie the same was con-
tinent.” (Zumpt, <> 127.)—-Admirandum in modum. “To a wonder-
ful degree.''—- Commissa celans. “A keeper os secrets.⁷‘ Literally,
⁴⁶ lieeping concealed things committed to him.”—Quod interdum, &c.
This should rather come after studiosus audiendi, since there is no
reference llere to any advantage, but to the discharge os a duty.—
Discrte. “Eloquently.''--Disci. “That information was acquired.”
Literally, “that it was learned.'' Taken impersonally.

IX. GONON.

CHAPTER Ι.

Οόηῦπ Atheniensis. The Greeii form of the name of this corn-
mander is Kdvmv.—Pcloponncsio bello. The Peloponnesian war
lasted from B.C. 431 to 405.—Acccssit ad rempublicam. “Entered
upon public lise.” More literally‚ “drew near to the republic.”
Consult note on Vit. Themist, chapter ii., <j l.—Magni suit. “ WVas
os great value.’' Supply pretii. The genitive of value. (Zumpt,

bazus and Conon cruised about the islands and coasts of the AEgcan‚
expelled the Lacedaemonian harmosts srom the maritime towns, and
won over the inhabitants by assurances of their being freed from
foreign garrisons. Nepos, as we have just remarked, may have had
this state of things in view when he penned the language os the
text; but, if so, he has committed a very grave error in consound-
ing the times of events, sor the victory off Cnidus was gained aster
the Peloponnesian war, in Ro. 394.

In qua potestate. “ In the exercise of which authority.'’ Potestas
has here its usual meaning of delegated power3 and there is no
reference whatever, as some suppose, to any extraordinary com-
mission.—-Phcras cepit. Not Pherae in Thessaly, which was never
colonized by the Lacedaemonians, but Pherae, a town of Messenia, on
the Messenian Gulf, near the confines os Laconia. It was annexed
to Laconia by Augustus, aster the battle os Actium. There is no

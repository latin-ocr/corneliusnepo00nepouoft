CHAPTERIV.
§r

Conflixerat apud Rhodanum, διο. This is inaccurate. Scipio carne
too late to dispute the passage of the river. There was merely an
unimportant conflict of cavalry after the crossing‚ in which the Ro-
mans had the advantage—P. Cornelio Scipione. The father of Scipio
Africanus, and the brother of Cneus Scipio—Clastidii. “ At Clas-
tidium.” Put for apud or ad Clastidium, the name of the place be-
ing given, also, to the surrounding territory. This, however, is
rare. Clastidium was a sortified town of the Ananes, in Gallia
Cispadana, not far from the Po, on the road from Dertona to Pla-
centia. No battle, however, took place here between Hannibal and
Scipio. The first engagement in Italy was that in the plains to the
west of the Ticinus, where the superiority of Hannibal’s Numidian
horse at once decided the combat in his favor. The town of Clastid-
ium was taken aster this battle, and before that os the Trebia, by
treachery, a native of Brundisium, who commanded it sor the Ro-
mans, having betrayed it to Hannibal--Saucium inde, &o “He
sends him away thus wounded and routed.⁷’ This would rather ap-
ply to the battle os Ticinus, in which Scipio was severely wounded.
It is probable, therefore, that the previous clause respecting Clas
tidium is a mere interpolation.

§2

Tiberio Longo. Tiberius Sempronius Longus—Apud Trebiam.
‘⁴ At the Trebia.” This was a small river in Gallia Cisalpina, falling
into the Po near Placentia. This river, now the Trcbba, is gener-
ally dry in summer, but is filled with a rapid stream in winter, which
was the season when Hannibal defeated the Romans—Cum his.
Not correct. Hannibal fought the battle with Longus only, Scipio
being still enfeebled by his wound, and, moreover, advising against
an engagement.-— Utrosque. Consult notes on Dae„ xi„ 2.—Imle per
Ligures. By the Ligures, or “Ligurians,’' are meant the inhabit
ants os Liguria, a district ofItaly‚ bounded on the west by the River

' Varus and the Maritime Alps, and of which Genua, the modern

Genea, was the capital. Nepos is not very accurate here in his ac-
count of Hannibal·s movements. According to Livy, the Cartha-
ginian commander made an attempt to cross the Apennines before
the winter was well over, but was driven back by violent storms.

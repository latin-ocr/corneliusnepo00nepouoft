the Macedonians, Magnesians, and others, amounted to three hund-
red thousand men. Is we add to this the number ofmen in the ficet
and transports, the whole number of fighting men will be two millions
six hundred and sorty-one thousand, one hundred and ten. And is
we add again to this the sollowers computed to have accompanied
the expedition, the sum total will be five millions two hundred and
eighty three thousand, two hundred and twenty3 and Xerxes, ac·
cording to Herodotus, conducted so many as sar as Sepias and Ther-
mopylae.

QG.

Cujus. Referring to Xerxes—Et maxime Athenienses peti ιῖῑεε-
rentur. “And the Athenians were said to be chiefly aimed at.''—
Delphos. *ί To Delphi.’‘ The local accusative, denoting motion
whither. Delphi was a city of Phocis, on the southern declivity of

junctive is here employed because the clause contains an indirect

Pelcam pro parma fecit. ‘⁸ Made the targe (to be used) in place of
the round shield.⁷' The pelta was a small light shield, consisting
principally of a frame-work of wood or osier, covered with skin or
leather, and without the metallic rim. It had generally a semicir-
cular indentation on one side, giving it a crescent—like appearance.
The parma, was strictly a small round shield, but in the present pas-
sage it is evidently used in the sense of clypeus. The meaning of
the whole passage is, that Iphicrates introduced the pelta extensively
into use in the Greek armies, and made it supersede the large, heavy
shield; for the pelta was used long before his time by the Thracians,
and even by Greek troops, as appears from many places in Xeno-
phon’s Anabasis.—Hestraorai pedites appellantur. “Foot soldiers
are called Peltastae,'' i. e., targe-bearers. Observe the employment
of the present to indicate a regular and constant appellation. In an
historical point of vieW, the text is loosely worded. The term ire).-
τασταί was not brought in for the first time after this improvement
of Iphicrates, but had been employed long before to denote a species
of light-armed infantry. Iphicrates merely introduced some im-
provements in the mode of arming them, combining, as far as pos·
sible, the peculiar advantages of heavy and light armed soldiers.
This equipment became very common subsequently among the
mercenary troops, and proved very effective, but the employment
of heavy-armed men was not, in consequence, entirely discontinued,
nor were the infantry all called πελτασταί, but only a particular part
of them. The peltast style of arming became general among the
Achaeans, however, until Philopoemen again introduced heavy ar-
mor.

Ad motus concursusque leviores. “ Nimbler for movements in gen-
eral, as well as for engagements with the soe.''—Loricarum. “Of
cuirasses.’' The cuirass, or coat of mail commonly worn by the
Greeks, more especially in the earlier ages, consisted principally of
a breastplate made of hard leather, or of bronze or iron, covering
the breast and abdomen 3 and of a corresponding plate covering the
back. They were united on the right side by hinges3 on the other
side, and sometimes on both sides, they were fastened by means of
buckles. Sometimes the cuirass was formed ofiron books or rings
joined together, and affixed to an under coat ofleather ; and again,
at times, it was composed of such rings or hooks alone—Pro sertis
atque aneis linteas dedit. ‘⁴ In the place ofthose oscham-mail, and,
moreover‚ of bronze, he gave them linen ones.” Sertis is a par·
ticiple of sero, and so means ‘⁴ set in order,’' “joined,⁷’ or “ connect-

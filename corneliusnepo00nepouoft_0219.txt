Legatos ad eum cum εεμίᾰῖᾶ miserunt. “ They sent commissioners
tatto him with a scycdl5‚'’ τ’. e., with a dispatch. We have purposely
sostened down legatos in translating. Thucydides says that the
Spartans sent merely a herald with the scytale, which is certainly
the more probable statement. The scytale (σκυτάλη) was properly
a staff used at Sparta as a cipher surr writing dispatches. Thus, a
strip ofpaper or parchment was rolled slantwise around it, on which
the dispatches were written lengthwise‚ so that, when unrolled, they
were unintelligible. Commanders abroad had a staff os like thick-
ness, round which they rolled these papers, and so were able to read
the dispatches. Hence the term scytale, from meaning the staff
around which the dispatch was wound, came to signify the dispatch
itsels, asin the present instance—More illorum. ‘⁶ After their maii-
ner,” i. e., with Laconic brevity.

publica—carebat. “KVas lte sree srom.’' Literally, “did he want.'’
—Eum cum rege habere societatem. “That he had a secret under-
standing with the king.'’ Nepos uses rex here, as the Greek writ-
crs do βασιλεύς, in a kind os absolute sense, to denote the king os
Persia.

Genus quoddam hominum, &e ‘¹ A certain class of men which is
called Helots.” Observe that the relative here refers back to the
preceding noun genus. The stricter form of expression would have
been qui Ilotae vocantur. (Zumpt, ᾧ 372.) The term Ιίῡιω comes
from the Greek Εὶλῶται. Another and more usual form is Helotcs
from the Greek Εἵλωτες. The Helots were Spartan bondsmen,
usually employed in agriculture and other unwarlike labors, but
sometimes also enrolled as soldiers, and not without the capacity

and conch-noverings (ἱματίων καὶ στρωμάτων).-Ιη praesentia. Lit-
erally, “ sor present times,'⁷ i. a, sor present use. Supply tempora.
Some, less correctly, regard praesentia as the ablative singular.—
In ignem ejectis. ‘⁴ Having been thrown out upon the fire.” They
were flung out os the house upon the flames. Observe the force of

B.C. 352.-Malcdice⁷ztissimi. ⁴‘ Though very much addictcd to speak-
ing ill of others.” Theopompus is said to have been extravagantly
severe in his censure, and unbounded in his praise. Timaeus was
so fond of censuring others, that he obtained the nickname of

Epitz'maeus‚ or “the fault-finder.'’—Conscz'crunt. “Have agreed.”
From conscisco.

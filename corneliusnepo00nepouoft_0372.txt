356 moras on 'rna 1,an or· EUMENEs‘.

—Eundem locum obtinuisset. “ Had held the same post.'‘— Unun·
Supply annum. The common text has uni, agreeing with alae, whicn
is interium—Imperator. “As commander.’'—Repulisset. Since he
was always the party assailed.—Talcm habuit exitum vitae. After
the sic at the beginning os the chapter, a simple expression like oc-
cubuit ought to have been employed here. The interval, however,
aster sic is so long, that the latter term is virtually disregarded.

§Q 3.

In quo. “ Of whom.’' Lambinus conjectured de quo, but in witn
the ablative has a force here analogous to that of dc (literally, “in
the case of whom,” i. e., in reference to whom), and like ἐν some-
times in Greek with the dative. (Bremi, ad loc. Compare Madvig,
§230, Obs.‚ l.)—Proefcctus. “ Governors’

Iidem post, dcc. From this to aperuerunt still depends on quod.—
Statim. Incorrect. It was some years Subsequent to the death of
Eumenes, and aster the mother and the two sons of Alexander had
been put to death by Cassander—Regium ornatum nomenque. “The
attire and name os king.’'—Se regnum servare. ‘¹ That they were
keeping the kingdom.”—Proestare. ¹⁴ To perform.”—Uno propug-
natore. “ Their only desender‚’' i. e., the only desender os the chil-
dren of Alexander.—-Quid sentirent aperuerunt. “They disclosed
what their real sentiments were.'' Literally, “what they (really)
selt.’‘—Hujus sceleris principes. ‘⁴ The leaders in this wickedneSS.”
—Antigonus, Ptolomeus, διο. Namely, Antigonus and Seleucus in
Asia, Ptolemy in Egypt, Lysimachus in Thrace, Cassander in Mac-
edonia. These five first assumed the regal title B.C. 306. Cas-
sander, son of Antipater, married the half-sister os Alexander, and
aster his father's death obtained possession of Macedonia, over
which he reigned sor eighteen years.

§4

Militari honesto sunere humaverunt. “ celebrated his obsequies
with a splendid military funeral.‘’ Humaverunt literally means “ in-
terred‚‘’ or “buried in the earth.’' Here, however, it has a more
extensive signification, and refers to all the arrangements of the
funeral, including even the burning os the empse—Honesta sunere.
Not honestoque. Consult notes on Dat„ iii., 2: “agresti duplici am-
iculo.’'— comitante tolo exercitu. This statement is erroneum.—
Uxorem. Alexander gave in marriage to Eumenes Attonis (Plu-
tarch calls her Barsine), a Persian princess, εἰ· the same time that
he himself married Statira, the daughter os Darius-Deponanda.
“ Should be conveyed,” i. e., in a funeral urn.

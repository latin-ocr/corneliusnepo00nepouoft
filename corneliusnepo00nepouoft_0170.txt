ᾧ 1.

cujus victoriae, διο. “ It does not appear foreign (to my subject)
to inform (the reader) what kind of reward for this victory was
given unto Miltiades.” After alienum supply a re. The relative
cujus, commencing the sentence, is to be construed as a demonstra·
tive. (Zumpt, ἑ) 803) The genitive victoria: depends on premium.
—Naturam “Tlmt the character.” We have given natura here
the meaning assigned to it by Daehne. The reference is to the
movements, or the course os affairs natural to all free states.

Populi nostri honores. ‘⁶ The honors bestowed by our own coun-
trymen‚” i. e., the Romans. Observe that the genitive has here·
what grammarians term a subjective (i. e., active) force—Rari et
tenues. “Rare and of slight value.’'——Effusi atque obsoleti. “EX-

worr. out‚” ‘⁶ what is become old from constant use,'' and hence
gets ‘lie general signification os ‘¹ worthless’‘ or ⁴⁴ common.’‘—Fu-
isse. 'Por cos fuisse.

this very Miltiades.'' The pronoun huic is here strongly emphatic,
and is the same in effect as if we were to say, ‘¹ Unto this same Mil-
tiades, who had so gloriously distinguished himself.” Nepos often
employs hic where other writers use is, illc, talis, dcc—Talis honos.
‘⁴ Such an honor (as the following merely),’' i. ε., no greater honor
than the following—In porticu, quoe, &c. ¹¹ In the portico which is
called Poecilc,” i. c., the “Decorated” Portico. By porticus (in Greek
Στοά) is meant a species os piazza, supported on columns. and in-

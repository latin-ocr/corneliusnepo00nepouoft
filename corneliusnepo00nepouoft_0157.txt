Lemnii sua sponte, dec. “And had demanded that the Lemnians
should do that os their own accord,'' i. e., should give themselves
up to the Athenians os their own free will. Supply ut before sace-

quum ille, domo, &c “When he, setting out from home with
ships, should have come to Le1nn0s⁸with the wind aquilo? ι’. e.‚ with
a northerly wind. By aquilo, however, is properly meant the north-
east wind—Ab septentrionibus. “ From the nortli.” By septentrio-
nes are properly meant the seven stars forming the constellation of
the Greater Bear, near the north pole. It is then taken sor the
north generally—Adversum tenet, διο. “ Holds on (a line of direc-
tion) full against those that come from Athens.” With tenet supply
cursum, with which adversum agrees. Athens lay in a southwestern
direction from Lemnos, but the course of a vessel toward Lemnos,

curs also with the genitive, as regni, imperii, but more especially in
the phrase rerum potiri, “to assume the supremacy.’⁷ (Zumpt,
ᾧ 466.) Once in Nepos it occurs with the accusative, ‘⁶ qui summam
imperii potirentur” (Vie. Eum, c. 3), but this reading has been dis-
puted.—Castellis idonea. “Suitable sor strongholds.’'—Prudentiri
quam felicitate. “ By good conduct than by good fortune.'' Litcr-
ally, “by prudence,‘' &c.——-Qumn devicisset. “After he had com-
pletely subdued.” Observe that quum here takes the subjunctive,
because a preceding event is represented as the cause os a subse-
quent one. (Zumpt, <5 578.)—Res constituit. “Hc established af-
fairs.’'—lbidem. Referring to the Chersoneso-Decrevit. From

ΗΓΒ or* DION. 267

§a

Ut se totum ci traderet. ‘⁴ That he gave himself wholly up to him.'
This account is fully confirmed by the language of Plutarch, in his
life of Dion—Quum crudeliter violatus essee. “Although he was
cruelly outraged.''—Quippe qui eum venumdari jussisset. We have
adopted here the conjectural emendation of Bremi. The common
reading, quippe quem υὲηιινηάᾶνί, &c., is a violation osLatinity. Plato
is the subject ofthe main clause, and the nominative to violatus esset,
and quem, in the relative clause, should refer, in strictuess, to Diony-
sius, but the common text, by a harsh change, refers quem to Plato,
and jussisset to Dionysius. The story to which Nepos refers is, that
Dionysius, offended at the sreedom of some of Plato's remarks, gave
him up to the Spartan Pollis, who was returning to Greece, and
urged him either to put him to death on the passage, or to sell him
as a slave. Pollis carried him to AEgina, the people ofwhich island
were at -war with the Athenians, and sold him there as a slave.
Anniceris‚ the Cyrenean‚ however, purchased him and restored him
to freedom. This story is told in different forms, and is of very
doubtful authenticity.—E0dem rediit. Nepos here makes Plato to
have paid his second visit to Syracuse during the life-time of the
elder Dionysius. This, however, as already stated by ηε, is an error.

Quo quum gravi conflictamur. ‘⁵ And when he was sore pressed
by it, being a severe one.” Equivalent in effect to quum eo, et qui-
dcm‘ gravi, conflictui-ctur.—1lIctj0rz' periculo. ⁴⁴ In greater danger than
ordinary.”-—Sororis sure filios. Dion wished the sons of his sister
Aristomache, one os the wives of Dionysius, to have a share of the
kingdom, and not that the younger Dionysius, the son of Doris, the
other wife, should succeed to the whole as the eldest-born son.

repose. The physicians, to ingratiate themselves with his success-

yet he looked like one merely buried in deep sleep.—-Diem, obiit su-

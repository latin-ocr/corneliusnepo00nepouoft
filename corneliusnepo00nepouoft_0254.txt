quartercd at Notium, near Ephesus, a general engagement was
brought on, in his absence and against his express orders, by the
rashness os his lieutenant Antiochus, on which occasion the Pelo-
ponnesian ficet, commanded by Lysander, gained the advantage.
This, though attended with no material loss, was enough to disgust
the Athenians‚ who seem to have considered Alcibiades's past suc-
cesses only as giving them a claim on him sor more brilliant ex-
ploits.-—In invidiam recidit. “ He again fell into odium.”

tratum abrogarent. “That they abrogated his authority in his ab·
sence.” Literally‚ “for him absent.'‘ Magistratus commonly re-
fers to civil, and imperium to military authority. Here, however,

gistratus in the sense of military power, as in Vit. Chabr„ chapter‘

himself—Primus Groeciae cit-itatis, &e “ He was the first individua}
from a Grecian state who penetrated into Thrace.'' He means the

V. OIMON.

CHAPTER 1.
<> 1.

Cimon. In Greek Κΐμων. He was named aster his paternal
grandfather. This elder Cimon, however, is only remembered
through the same of his son Miltiades; and scarcely any thing is
known of him except that he was remarkably stupid. Hence he
was nicknamed ὀ κοάλεμος, “ the booby.” The younger Cimon, the
subject of the present narrative, appears to have passed his early
youth in a manner not oreditable either to his morals or his intellect.
The worst excesses are laid to his charge. He even neglected
what in Athens were usually deemed the essential branches of a
liberal education ; so that, at this time, he also, like his grandfather,
incurred the charge of stupidity, and obtained the nickname of κοά-
λεμος. This apparent duflness, however, would appear to have been
nothing more in hss case than a natural reserve, combined with a
certain inaptitude to social vivacity or oratorical display. Nepos
makes no mention of this, nor of the excesses ofhis early lise.

Dura admodum initio, &e “ Experieneed a very hard commence-

period from fifteen to thirty years of age. This opinion, however,
is merely conjectural—Litem (estimatum. “ The fine assessed
against him.'’ Compare Vit. Mill„ chapter vii„ ᾧ 6.—P0pul0. The
dative, depending on solvere, not the ablative after ‹alimmum—In
vinculis puhlicis. ⁴⁴ In the public prison.''-Atheniensium. The corn-
mon text has Atheniensibus, sor which we have given Bremi's read-
ing—Nisi pecuniam solvisset. “Unless he should have paid the
money.” More sreely, “unless he pald the money.” This last is
our usual mode os translating the plupersect subjunctive, our lan-
guage not being so particular as the Latin in marking that one action
must have been comploted before another begins. (Arnold, ad loc.)

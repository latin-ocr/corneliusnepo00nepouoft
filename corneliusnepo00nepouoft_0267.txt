first battle, after Thrasybulus had occupied the Piraeeus. The slaugh-
ter, as Thirlwall remarks, was much less than might have been ex-
pected under the circumstances, and was probably restrained by the
humanity of the victors. Only severity of the common men in the
defeated army were killed—Nisi qui impugnare voluit. “Except
him who wished to attack first.⁷'-Jaccntcm. “As he lay,'' i. e.,
either wounded or siaiu—Ad victum. ‘⁶ To sustenance.”

In secundo praelio, &e Critias was slain in the first battle after
Thrasybulus had obtained possession of the Piraeeus-Dux tyranno-
rum. “The general of the tyrants.” Critias was, as before re-
marked, himself one of the thirty, and was conspicuous above all
his colleagucs for rapacity and cruelty. There fell along with him
in this battle liis colleague Hippomachus and his kinsman Char-
mides.—Ezadversus. Cqmpare Vit. Themist., chapter iii„ Q 4.

to the death of Critias, but to the overthrow of his power as the head

account is as follows ι At the sall of Critias, the thirty were deposed,
and a new college of ten, one from each tribe, was appointed in their
stead. The number of the followers of Thrasybulus gradually in
creasing, and an attack being even made on the city itself, the ten
applied sor assistance to Sparta, and Lysander was authorized to
raise a body of troops to suppress the insurrection. But deliveranee
came to the party of Thrasybulus from a quarter to which they coulu
least have looked sor it. The success, fame, and infiuence ot Ly
sander had excited jealousy, and perhaps alarm, in several ofthe
leading men at Sparta. Even the kings and ephori felt themselves
reduced to comparative insignificance by his side. His new expe
dition against the Athenian exiles appeared to his rivals an enter
prise in which the state had no interest, and which could only serve
his private ends by showing the importance of his patronage to the
faction now ruling at Athens. Pausanias, therefore, the colleague
of Agis, concerted measures with three of the ephori for haffling his
enterprise‚ and the result is stated generally in the text. (Thirt—

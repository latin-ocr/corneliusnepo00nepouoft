ever, seems sar fetched.—Ad optimas artes. “For the best arts‚”
i. e., the most important branches os knowledge—Corporis dignita-
tem. “Handsomeness os person.” The reference is to manly
beauty, as Billorbeck correctly explains the words-Qoeae non mini
mum commendatur. “Which does not a little recommend itselfi'
i. e.‚ which does not a little recommend a man. commendatur is
here employed in a reciprocal sense, or, in other words, is an in-
stance of the middle voice in Latin, a voice which is often errone-
ously confounded with the passive. Some editors, without any ne-
cessity, read commendat (scil. hominem).—Quas ipse tyranni muneri-
bus auxerat. Dion availed himself of his close connection and favor
with the tyrant to amass great wealth‚ so that, on the death of the
elder Dionysius, he offered to equip and maintain fifty triremes at
his own cost, to assist in the war against Carthage.

Obeuudo. “By discliarging.’‘—Administrando⁴ “By managing.”

There can be but very little doubt that the words fideliter adminis-
trando are a mere gloss that lias crept into the text, and are intended
to be explanatory os diligenter obeundo. The expression obire legati-
onem means, properly, “ to take upon one's sels an embassy‚’' but is
'here employed in a more extended sense to denote a discharge os
its duties. So thatfideliccr adnant-strando is not needed in the text.
-aSuspexerunt, ‘⁴ Admired.’' Suspicere, as here employed, is, prop-
erly, “ to look from below at some losty object which towers above
our heads ;” hence, ‘⁴ to admire,'’ “ to rovere,” &c

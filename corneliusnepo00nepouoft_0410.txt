Sardinia was rather out os the line osa voyage from Africa to Rome ς
and it is more likely that the acquaintance of Ennius aud Cato oo-
curred during the 'praetorship of the latter in the same island.-
Quintum Ennium. Ennius was a Greek by birth, aud a native οἵ
Rudiae in Calabria, but a subject of Rome, and served in the Cala-
brian levies in Sardinia. He was eminent both as a dramatic and
epic poet, and was regarded as the father of Roman song.

CHAPTER Π.

Consulatum gessit. “ He bore the consulship,” i. e.‚ the office ot
consul. This was in B.C. 195.—Hispaniam citeriorem. “Hither

any other foreign province. This account osNepos's is at variance
with that of Plutarch. The latter, in his lise os Cato, states that
Scipio, who was disgusted by Cato's severity, was actually appointed
to succeed him, but, not being able to procure srom the senate a
vote os censure upon the administration os his rival, passed the time

that in Rc. 194 Sextus Digitius was appointed to the province os
Hither Spain, it is probable that Plutarch was mistaken in assigning
that province to Scipio Africanus. The notion that Africanus was
appointed successor to Cato in Spain may have arisen from double

258 NOTES οΝ THE

besides, they took place aster Agesilaus had retired from Asia. w e
do not learn that Conon made any use of the powersul fieet over
which he was placed, during the campaigns os the Spartan monarch
in Asia Minor, and we are informem, indeed, that the want os money
kept him sor a time inactive. (Thirlwall, Hist. Gr„ c. xxxvi.)

Hic multum ducem summum, διο· Erroneous, os course, as ap-

r pears from what we have just remarked. Conon’s command was a
naval one, and his successes were subsequent to the campaigns of
Agesilaus in Asia—Neque vero nonfuit apertum. ‘⁴ And, indeed, it
was very apparent.’⁷ Observe the litotes in the Latin, and the sub-
stitution os the affirmative sor the double negative in English—Si
ille nonsuisset. “ Is he had not been there.’' Nepos means, corn-
manding a land soree against Agesilaus. Erroneously‚ oscourse.—
Tauro tenus. “ As sar as Taurus.’' The chain of Mount Taurus,
properly so called, commenced at the southeastern point os Asia
Minor, and proceeding eastward, parallel and near to the Mediter-
ranean, inclosed between itsels and the coast the narrow strip of
land which formed Pamphylia and Cilicia. At the River Pyramus
the chain divided into two, that of Amanus, which proceeded to the
east, separating Syria srom Asia Minor, and the continuation of Tau-
rus, which ran northeast‚ along the southeast of Cappadocia, across

. the Euphrates into the northern part os Armenia, where it joined

Mount Masius. The ordinary Roman division of Asia was into
“Asia on this side of the Taurus³⁷ and “Asia beyond Taurus,” or
Asia cis Taurum and Asia trans Taurum. Nepos, as a Roman
writer, follows this arrangement, and the countries meant by him,
in the phrase Tauro tenus, are Ionia, AEolis, Caria, Lycia, Lydia,
Phrygia, Cappadocia, and the regions along the southern shore of
the Euxine. This will embraee nearly the whole os what we call
Asia Minor.

Qui posteaquam domum, &e The recall os Agesilaus is commonly
ascribed to the inssuence os Persian gold, in exciting a movement
against Sparta among the Greeks at horne. It may reasonably be
doubted, however, whether seelings os Jealousy or resentment to-
ward Sparta were not the principal cause os the troubles which ew
sued. Compare the remarks of leirlwall, Hist. Gr„ c. xxxv.-Ver-
sabatur. ‘⁶ Was employed.’' More srecly, “ remained.”

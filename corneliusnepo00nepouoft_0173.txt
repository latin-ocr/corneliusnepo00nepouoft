operibus clausit. ‘⁴ Invested the city with military works.¹' By
opera are here meant all the military works required sor the besieg-
ing osa place, such as the ditch, the vallum or rampart, the towers
upon the vallum, &c.—C'mnmeatu. “ Supplies os provisions.”

Vincis ac testudinibus constitutis. “Vineae and testfidos having
been erected.” The vinea: were a species of sheds or mantlets, sup-
ported on poles, and either carried by the soldiers, or moved forward
on wheels. Under cover of them. the besiegers advanced to the
ramparts for the purpose of undermining, &c The testudos were
also covered military machines, moving on wheels, under the shelter
os which the soldiers worked the battering ram. It derived its name
from the resemblance which the movements of the battering ram
presented to those of the tortoise (testudo) when putting forth and
drawing back again its head. There was also another kind os tes-
tudo, formed by the soldiers’ locking their shields-over their heads
when‘advancing toscale the walls osa city.

Quum jam in eo esset, &c “ XVhen he was now on the point of
making himselfmaster of the town.'’ Literally, ‘⁴ when he was now
at that point os time that he was making himself master of the
town.” In such a sentence as the present, the construction, as
Heusinger remarks, may be either personal or impersonal ; that is,
we can either say in co sum ut hoc faciam, or z'n co cst (i. c., res)
ut hoc faciam. The latter of these, the impersonal construction, is
the more common of the two, but the former is the more forcible.
(Bremi, ad loc.)'—-In continenti. “ On the mainland.” Supply terraei
Ephorus, whom Nepos appears to have partly followed in his account,
makes the fire to have come from a forest on the island of Myconus,
which lay to the north of Paros. This seems far more reasonable
than the account given by our writer, since a fire on the continent
of Asia could not have been discerned at Paros on account of the
distance as well as of the islands that intervened.—Nescio quo casu.
“By some chance or other.'⁷ Nescio quis is here, as elsewhere.
equivalent simply to aliquis. (Zumpt, ζ) 553.)

Cujus flamma ut est vasa. “As soon as the blaze of this was
.seen.'’ In historical narratives, ut with the perfect indicative has
the force of “as soon as.” (Zumpt, <5 506.) Observe, moreover,
that cujus here, in the commencemcnt of the sentence, has the soree
of a demonstrative-Vena m opzmoncm. “ It occurred.‘' This is,
at best, a careless mode of expression. The true form would be
opinior vemt in mentem. We have this same carelessness repeated

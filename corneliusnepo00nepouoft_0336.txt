Idem quum, διο. B.C. 370.-Arcadum. “Of the Arcadians.''

ters—Orestem. Orestes, son of Agamemnon, put his mother Cly-
temnestra to death sor having murdered his father.-Alcmcroncm.

Huic in respondendo. The common text has hic, a much inferior
reading—Quum de ceteris perorasset. “XVhen he had coneluded
with regard to the other points.⁷' The peroratio was the winding
up osa speech, in which the orator recapitulated the arguments he
had employed, and made them tell upon the object he had in view.
-Opprobrz‘a. “Grounds of reproach.’'—Rlzccoris Attin: “Os the
Attio word-dealer.’' The term rhetor (properly, “a 1·betorician'’ or
“speaker'’) is bere used in a contemptuous sense, which we have
endeavored to imitate. Compare the German “Redemeister‚'’ as
employed by Nipperdey—Illos. Orestes, Alcmaeon, and OEdipus.—
Domi scelere admisso. The argument os Epaminondas embraces,
strictly speaking, only Orestes and OEdipus‚ and is simply this, that
they were born, it is true, the one in Argos, the other in Thebes,
but were born innocent, and that no blame can attach itselsto either
city merely on account os their having been born there. When,
however, they had committed the crimes in question, they were
each driven out from their birth-places and were received hythe
Athenians. That the Athenians‚ therefore, through their protect-
ing these guilty ones, became partners and accomplices in their guilt.

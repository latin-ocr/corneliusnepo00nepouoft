Per haruspicem. “By means os an haruspex.” Plutarch says
that Theopompus called him Satyrus, but that other writers gave
him the name of Orthagoras. An haruspex (in Greek ἱεροσκόπος)
’ was a priest, whose office it was to inspect the entrails os the vic-
tims offered in sacrifice, and thence draw his conclusions respect-
ing future events—Communemque affinem. “And a common con-
nection.'' Plutarch says his name was AEschylus‚ and that he was
brother to the wife of Timophanes—Manus non attulit. “Did not
apply his hands (to the work).”—Scd ne aspicere, &c. Other ac-
counts differ from this. Diodorus says that Timoleon slew him
with his own hand openly in the forum ; while Plutarch relates that
Timoleon introduced the assassins into his brother's house, but
turned his back while the deed was done—In proesidio. “On
guard.''-—Satclles. “ Armed follower.”

succeeding chapter) arrived at Corinth, and that during the whole
of this time Timoleon lived in solitude, a prey to sorrow and re-
morse. The narrative os Diodorus, however, appears more credi-
ble, that Timoleon slew his brother just before the arrival of the
Sicilian ambassadors.

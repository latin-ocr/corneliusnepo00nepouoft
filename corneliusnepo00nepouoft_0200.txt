rs “to consult any one ;‘’ consulare in aliquem, “to take mensures
against any one ;'' but consulere alicui, “ to consult for any one,'’ i. e.,
sor his interests or welsare.-Tuto cum versari. “For him to live
sasely.'' Versari is, properly, ‘⁵ to turn one's sels about‚'’ ‘⁸ to move
up and down‚’' “to live,'’ ‹Sec—Pydnam dodaci. “ To be conducted
to Pydna,’⁷ z. e., to be escorted thither. Pydna was a city os Mac-
edonia on the western coast os the Sinus Thermaicus, above Dium.

Hic in navem ascendit. ‘⁸ Here he went on board a ship,’‘ z. ε., he
took ship. Ascendere in navem is the common expression sor going
on board a ship, the reference being to the climbing os the vessel's
sides—Naxum. “Toward Naxus.‘' This was one os the Cyclades,
and lay to the east os Paros—Quis sit aperit. Observe that it is
quis sit, and not qui sic. The expression quis sit is to give his name,
or some other indication, by which he may be distinguished from
au other men, whereas qui sit relates more to quality, rank, posi-
tion, &c. The true reading, therefore, here is quis sit, since The-
mistocles diselosed his name, and made himself actually known to
the master of the vessel, as plainly appears from the context. Com-
pare Zumpt, o 135, note—Si sc conservasset. Observe that se, not
eum, is employed, because the reference is to the leading subject of
the clause. (Zumpt, o 550.) The plupersect is used because the
promise would not be due until the master os the vessel had saved
him. According to the received account, Themistocles worked not
only upon the hopes of the ship-master by large promises, but also
upon his fears, by threatening to denouncc him as having knowingly
sheltered an outlaw. On this latter head Nepos is silent.

Captus. “ Seized.’'—Dicm noctemque. ‘⁴ For a night and a day.''
Sometimes, though not in the present instance, this form of expres-
sion means “day and night‚” denoting an unbroken continuance. In
this latter sense, however, the plural is more commonly employed.
-Ρνῦειιί ab insula in εᾶῖο. “At some distance from the island, on
the open sea.'’ Salam answers to the Greek σάλος, and denotcs
the open exposed sea, opposite a harbor. Hence procul is employed
here, this being a general term for distance, whether great or small.
Longe would have been too strong. The stress os weather would
bo. a sufficient pretext sor the movcmcnts of the slim-master.—

mua or· THEM1s'rocLES. 163

the editions have Acharnanam civem in place os Habicarnassmm,
meaning “ a female citizen of Acharnae.” This, however, can not
be correct. Plutarch expressly states that Themistocles was not
of pure Athenian or Attic blood on the mother’s side, which he
certainly would have been is that parent had been a native of the
borough of Acharnae in Attica. Phanias, a writer quoted by Plu-
tarch, makes the mother os Themistocles to have been a Carian;
while Neanthes, another ancient writer, mentions Halicarnassus as
her native city. Hence Aldus changed Aclzarnanam into Halicar-
nassiam, and has been followed by several editors. We have adopted
the same reading, but have gone a step sarther, and thrown out civem,
it being more than probable that some blundering copyist has made
Acharnanam civem out of Halicarnassz'am. Some read Acarnanam,
“of Acarnania,'’ but the adjective in that case would have been
Acarnamcam. Compare Liv„ xxvi, 25.

Minus probatus parentibus. “An object of displeasure to his pa-
rents.''' More literally, “less acceptable.’' Probatus, when con-
strued with the dative, as here, is taken adjectively, and refers to
general conduct or deportment. WVhen construed with a or ab and
the amative, it is the participle, and then rolates merely to some one
single action or particular.—Lib5rius. “ Too freely,'’ i. e., too disso-
lutely. Equivalent in effect to liberius justa—Negligffibac. Observe
that negligere here implies not simple neglect merely, but wastesul
and extravagant conduct, as the main cause of such neglect.

The zacynthians then scized Dion, and endeavored to stranglc nim
but, not succeeding in this, they called sor a sword. No one, how-
ever, durst open the door, sor Dion had many friends about him;
yet they had, in fact, nothing to sear from them, sor each concluded
that by giving up Dion he should consult his own safety. When
they had waited some time, Lycon, a Syracusan, put a short sword
through the window into the hands osa Zacynthian, who fell upon
Dion, already stunned and senseless, and cut his throat like a vietim
at the altar.

CHAPTER X.
ᾧ 1.

Visendi. Put here, as often elsewhere, sor videndi, but with the
additional idea of gratisying curiosity, os taking great interest in a
matter, &c.-Ab insciis. ‘⁴ By those who were ignorant (of the real
authors os the deed).'’—Dilato. “ Having been spread abroad.”—-

passage—Ut. . . ..siposscnt . . . .cupcrcnt redimere. The imperfect
subjunctive for the plupersect. This is a peculiarity of the Latin
tongue which has very needlessly been opposed by many commen—
tators. It is true, it is, in fact, an irregularity, but the air of ani-
mation which it imparts to the sentence forms a sufficient excuse
sor it. The sact related is thereby thrown back into the period of
past time in which it occurred—Ab Acheronte. “From the lower
world.’' Litcrally‚ “srom Acheronst’ Acheron was one os the sa-
bled rivers of the lower world, and the name is here employed by a
species ospoetical synecdoche, to denote the world of the dead itself.

Celeherrimo Ioco. “ In the most frequented part.'’ More litei-any,
“in a place very much crowded‘' or “thronged.” Observe here
the peculiar force os celeberrimo, and compare note on embricam,

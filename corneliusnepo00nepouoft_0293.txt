mma or DION. 277

-Conjuratione confirmae. “ He confirms them in their intention by
forming an actual conspiracy with them.’' With conjuratione supply
sacta 0r inieci. Some editions give conjurationem confirmat, a much
feebler reading.

Multis consciis quae ger-erfitur. “ Since it was carried on with thr
privity of many.'’ The subjunctive is here employed, since the
reason is stated. (Zumpt, ς) 564.)-Είατᾶ defertur. “Is divulged
and carried to.’' Literally‚ “being divulged, is carried to.'’ Ob-
serve that elata has here the force of cnmztz‘ata. Compare Herzog,
ad Coes., B. G„ i., tiu—Conveniunt. “ Go unto him‚'’ τ’. e„ have an
interview with him. Supply cum, and compare note on convenit, <5 3.
—NZgatfierz' insidias. “Assures them that no plot is being sormed.”
—Praecepto suo. “ By his direction.'' Plutareh's account differs
from this. He states that the existence of a plot was at length sus-
pected by both Dion and his wife and sister, but that Dion, to whom
the murder of Heraclides had been a source, in all probability, of
great distress and anxiety‚ frequently declared, that rather than live,
not only in sear os his enemies, but in suspicion os his friends, he
would die a thousand deaths, and freely open his bosom to any one
who wished to dispatch him.

In cedem Proserpinae, διο. It was the temple, properly, of Ceres
and Proserpina, or the mother-goddess and her daughter, and ap-
pears, from the employment os deducunt in the text, and os καταὸάς
by Plutarch, in his account of this same affair, to have been in the
lower part of the city.—Jurarc cogunt. The mode ostaking the oath
is given by Plutarch. After the pcrsormance ofsome religious rites‚
the individua} who was to take the oath put on the purple robe of
Proserpina, and, holding a blazing torch in his hand,‘swore to the
truth of his statement, or that he would keep his plighted saith, dcc„
imprecating‚ at the same time, destruction on himself and his family
in case he proved saithless. Plutarch adds, that Callicrates (or Cal-
lippus, as he calls him), in order to show in what contempt he held
the two goddesses, actually appointed the day of the festival os Pros-
erpina sor the outbreak os the conspiracy.—Hac religione. ·‘ By this
solemn obligation.’' ’

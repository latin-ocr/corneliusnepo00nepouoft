Nam Chersonesi, &c “ For during all the years that he had dwelt
(there), he had held, without intermission, the sovereignty of the
Chersonesus.” WVe have followed Daehne in making Chersone-<n
depend on dominationem. Bremi, less correctly, makes it the loca-
tive‚ and connects it with habitarat. Observe that annos is the ac-
cusative of continuance of time—Obtinuerat. The true meaning
of obtinere is to hold against another, to keep, to enjoy, &c.—Tyran·
nus, scd justus. ‘³ A tyrant, it is true, but a just one.’' Nepos gives
the definition os tyrannus immediately after-Erat consecutus. Sup-
ply eam, sc. dominationem—Eam potestatem. It is called potestas
here, because it is said to have been conferred suorum voluntate.
Had he obtained it vi, it would have been potentia—Qui potestate
sunt perpetua. ‘⁴ VVho are become possessed of permanent power.‘’
We have, in accordance with settled usage, rendered the term ty-
rannus by the English word “ tyrant‚” although, strictly speaking,
‘⁶ usurper'' would have answered better. The term τύραννος first
began to be used in the time os Archilochus, and became common
in Theognis, Pindar, and Herodotus, when, free constitutions having
superseded the old hereditary sovereignties, all who obtained abso-
lute power in a state were called τύραννοι, “ tyrants,’' ‘⁴ usurpers ;’‘
so that the term rather regards the way in which the power was
gained than how it was exerciscd. Asterward, however, as usur-
pation leads to violence, the word soon came to imply reproach.
and was then used like our tyrant or despot. In the present case
the earlier meaning prevails.— Usa est. ‘⁴ Was wont to enjoy.”

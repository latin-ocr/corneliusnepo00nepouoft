verens ne pcrsszraret. Observe that perseveraret is here employed,
and not Ρεγεὲυὲνεε, because verens actually refers tc past time, being
connected with sccit.—Id agi. “That the following scheme was
now on foot.’' Literally, “that this was getting done.''—Quem ille
in Hellesponto fecerat. Compare Vit. Mile„ chapter iii„ ᾧ l.—Dissol-
veritur. ‘⁴ Should be broken up.’' More literally, “should be dis-
connected‚” or ‘⁶ taken apart.” The expression is a very proper one
here, since the bridge was made of boats connected together—Ac
excluderetur. “And he should be shut out.” Observe here the
change of subject, the reference being now to Xerxes. We would
have expected ac ipse excludemum but similar instances are not
uncommon in our author. Compare chapter ix„ ζ) 3; Vz't. Epam.⁷
x.‚ 1 ; Τιήιοί., i.‚ (53, dra—quue ci persuasit. ‘⁴ And he persuaded
him of this.’' LiteralIy, ‘⁶ he persuaded this unto him.'' Observe
the government of persuadeo, namely, the dative of the person and
the accusative of the thing. (Zumpt, ᾧ 407.)

ᾧ 2.

Qud sex mcnszbus, &e “By what way he had made his march
(thither) in six months, by that same way he retu1·ned,'' διο. Ob-
serve that qud and eddam are used here apparently with an adverbial
force, but in reality have each υίᾶ understood. lisinas is for minus
quam.—-R3vcrsus est. This form of the perfect, instead of rEvertz't,
is not usual prior to the Augustan age. Cicero never uses it.
(Zumpt, ᾧ 209.)-8ιῖρέι·ᾶιωη. Supply csse. So, also, after conserva-
tum.

ᾧ 3.

Succscbuic. “Succiiliibed.”—Hoec aller-a victoria. “This is the
second victory.” Supply est, and Observe the force of altera, as in-
dicating one 0f two. (Zumpt, ᾧ 141.) Secunda would have been
less precise, “a seeond.''——Cztm Marathonio cropoeo. “With the
Marathonian trophy‚” i. c.‚ 'with the Marathonian victory. The
trophy‚ which commemorates the victory, is here put sor the victory
itselfi-Possit, The subjunctive is here employed to express a
modest reserve on the part of the writer, who will not state his own
opinion openly, but leaves the decision ofthe point to the judgment
of the reader. Possit, therefore, is equivalent here to the Greek
δύναιτ’ ‹hx—Pari modo. ‘⁸ In like 1nanner‚'’i. e„ in the same way
as at Marathon, where a larger force was conquered by a smaller
one—Post hominum memoriam. ‘⁴ Since the remembranee os men‚’'
i. e.‚' since we have had any history &mankind—Est devicta. ‘⁴ NVas
completely conquei·ed.’' Observe the force of de in composition

leys to follow them, and obscrve their proceedings aster their land-

that he allowed his own men to go ashore. On the fifth day, how
ever, he ordered the galleys which followed the Atheniens to the op-
posite shore, as soon as the latter should have lauded and become
seattered over the country, to return, and in the middle of the chan-
nel to hoist a shield. WVhen this signal was raised, he ordered the
whole fleet to pusii across at its utmost stretch of speed. Os the six
Athenian generals, Conon alone was on the watch, and observed
the enemy's approach. His own galley and eight others, including
the Paralus, were soon manned ; but this only enabled them to make
their escape. The erews os the rest were too sar oss' to be rccalled
by the signal which he gave, and Lysander found the ships nearly
empty, and took possession of them, while Thorax, who commanded
the land forces, scoured *the country with his troops, and made the
greater part os the men prisoners.

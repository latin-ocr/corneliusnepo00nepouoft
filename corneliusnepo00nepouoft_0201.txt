mm] 01³ THEMISTOCLES. 185

Ephesum. Ephesus was a celebrated Greek city of Ionia in Asia
Minor, at the mouth of the River Cayster, north of Miletus, and
south of Smyrna—Cui ille pro merim, &c “And the latter aster-
ward requited him in accordance with his deserts.” Observe that
cui ille is equivalent here to ct ci ille, the pronoun ille referring to
Themistocles.

CHAPTER ΙΧ.

Plerosque. Compare notes on Proef, <p l.—-lta scripsisse. ‘⁴ Have
written to the following effect.” Ita is not superfluous here, as
some suppose, but is purposely employed sor emphasis—Xerxe reg-
nante. The discrepancy here alluded to may be easily explained.
WVhen Themistocles arrived in Asia, Xerxes was still on the throne ;
but not many months after this he was assassinated by two os the
great officers of his cssurt, Artabanus, and the eunuch Spamitres.
The conspirators charged Darius, his eldcst son, with the murder,
and persuaded Artaxerxes, the younger, instantly to avenge the im-
puted parricide by the execution os his brother. After this, Arta-
banus, who was the father of seven sons in the prime oslise, waited
only till matters should be ripe sor removing the young king, and
establishing a new dynasty. He was afterward, however, betrayed
by a Persian nobleman, to whom he revealed his design‚ and per-
ished in an attempt to murder Artaxerxes. It appears to have been
in the interval between the death of Xerxes and this event that
Themistocles arrived at the Persian court. The latter, therefore,
came into Asia while Xerxes was reigffing, but made his applica-
tion sor protection to Artaxerxes his successor. (Thirlwall, Hist.
Gr., ii., p. 386, seq.)

Thucydidi ενὲᾱο. “ Give credence to Thucydides.” Compare
notes on chapter i., <> 4. Credo, with the accusative, is ‘⁴ to believe
a thing ;'’ with the dative, “to give credence to‚’' “to rely upon‚”
‹Sto—Quod aetate protimus, dcc. ‘⁴ Because, in point os time, he was
the nearest of those who,” διο. After proximus supply ex iis. The
demonstrative pronoun is osten omitted when it does not stand in
the same case with the relative, though still more frequently when
it does. (Zumpt, ᾧ 765.)—Ejusdcm civitatis. Both were Athenians.

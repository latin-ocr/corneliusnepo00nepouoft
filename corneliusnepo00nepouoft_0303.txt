nian.” He listened to the entreaties of Eurydice, the widow of
Amyntas ΙΙ. (who had adopted Iphicrates as his son), and drove out
from Macedonia the pretender Pausanias. This was about ΒΟ. 367,
when he was sent against Amphipolis—Perdiccae ει Philippi. Per-
dIccas came first to the throne, and reigned as Perdiccas III. He
was slain in battle by the Illyrians, and was succeeded by Philippus,

Vixit ad senectutem. The exact date of his death is not known,
but Demosthenes (c. Medd„ p. 534) speaks os him as no longer alive
at that time (B.C. mex—Causam capitis semel dixit. “He defended
himselfonce on a capital charge.” More literally, “he once pleaded
acause involving his own lise.’'-Bello Sociulz'. ‘⁵ In the Social war‚’'
i. e., the war of the allies. This was the war waged by Byzantium,
Chios, Rhodes, and Cos, which states had formed a coalition in order
to defend themselves against the attacks with which Athens, as they
thought, was threatening their independence. After the death os
Chabrias, Iphicrates, TImothEus, and Menestheus were joined with
Chares as commanders in this war, and were prosecuted by their
unscrupulous colleague, either because they had refused to risk an
engagement (for which he was anxious) in a storm‚ or because he
wished to screen himself from the consequences of his own rash-
ncss in actually engaging.—Esc absolutus. Polyaenus (iit, 2, 15)
says that while the trial was proceeding‚ Iphicrates introduced into
the court a body of partisans armed with daggers, and that he him-
self took care that the judges should see his sword during the trial.
He and Menestheus were acquitted. Timotheus was arraigned

afterward, probably in the following year (BC. 354), and condemned
to a heavy fine.

Inter eum ct Heraclidem, &e Plutarch, in the Life of Dion, relates
various iutrigues and artful movements on the part os Heraclides, in
order to deprive Dion of his popularity. The account given by Di·
odorus (xvi, 17) is more favorable to Heraclides—Quod principa-
tum non concedebat. “Because he did not yield the superiority (to
Dion).”—Comparavit. “ Formed.'‘ More literally‚ “got together.’'
—Apud optimates. “Among the higher classes.” As regards the
true soree of the term optimates, consult Dict. Ant„ s. v. Nobiles.—
Ezercilum pedestrem. “ The land army.''

Animo oequo. “With a patient mind.''-—Et retulit. “But re-
peated.’⁷—Ez secunda rhapsodia. “From the second rhapsody‚”
i. e., from the second book. The term rhapsodia (ῥαψῳδία) is here
employed in its ordinary sense, name1y, a portion os an epic poem
fit for recitation at one time, as, sor example, a book of the Iliad or
Odyssey. When it stands alone, as iu the present case, without
any mention of the poem, the Iliad is meant, as the more splendid
production of the two—Haza sententia. “This sentiment.”—Non
posse hene geri, &e ‘⁴ Thm a state can not he well managed by the
orders os many.'’ Respublica is here employed in the sense os the
Greek πολιτεία, to designate a civil polity or sorm of government.
she passage of Homer to which Nepos refers is as follows:

οὐκ ἀγαθὸν πολυκοιρανίη· εἷς κοίρανος ἔστω,
εἷς βασιλεύς.-(ΙΙ., ii., 204, seq.)

“The government os many is not a good thing; let there be one
mler‚ one king.”—2lIagna invidia. ‘⁴ Great odium.’‘—Aperuisse vi-
{ebatur velle. “He appeared to have disclosed (by this) that he
wished.” With velle supply se.

Hanc. “This odium.'’ Supplyinvidiam—Obsequio. “Byacon-
ciliatory deportment.’‘—Acerbitate. “By severity.'’—Interficiemlum

were opposed to Heraclides broke into his house and slew him.

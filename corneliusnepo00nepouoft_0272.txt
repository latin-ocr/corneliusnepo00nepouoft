was taken in the spring os 393, when Conon, in eonjunction with
Pharnabazus, sailed to the coast os Laconia, made descents on va—

Fuit etiam, &e. The times are here eonsounded as above re
marked, the transactions referred to in the previous section having
in a great measure taken place aster the close os the Peloponnesian
war—Apud AEgos flumen. Consult note on Vit. Lysand„ chapter
i., ᾧ 2.-—Scd tum abfuit. Another grave error. Conon was present

mere quibbling.—Illam calamitatem. ‘⁴ That disaster.” The battle
os AEgospotamos gave the final blow to the power os the Athenians,
and put an end to the war.

“From what quarter.'' opposed to ubi, in the previous clause.—
Praesidz'o civibus. Observe the double dative, the one of the person,
the other os the purpose or intention. (Zumpt, §422).—Eumdcmquo.

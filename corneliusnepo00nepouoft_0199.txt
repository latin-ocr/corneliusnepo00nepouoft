ficerat, to indicate that this friendship had formerly existed, but was
now broken off. Themistocles, it seems, in the day of his power,
had thwarted the Molossian prince in an application which he had
occasion to make to the Athenians‚ and had added insult to his dis-
appointment. Hence the rupture os their previous friendship.

In praescnciii. “At the time.’' The accusative plural neuter 01
proesens, with tempora understood, and not, as some maintain, the ab·
lative singular ospraesentz'a, ae.—Quo majore religione, &Q “In order
that he might protect himself, in case he were received, by a stronger
obligation of religion.’' Receptum is here equivalent to the Greek
ἂν ἀποδεχθέντα-Ανγὶραὶι. “He caught up.‘’ This does not agree
with the received account, according to which, Phthia, the queen
of Admetus, in the absence of her husband, instructed Themisto-
cles how to act, and placed the child in his arms. There appears
to be also another error here on the part of Nepos, in making thc
child to have been a daughter. According to Thucydides and Plu-
tarch, it was a son—In sacrarium. ‘⁴ Into a chapel,” ι’. e., a private
sanctuary under the palace roos. Here again Nepos differs from
the received authorities. According to Thucydides, he seated him-
self, in accordance with the directions of Phthia, on the hearth‚ by
the family altar.—Summc'z coerimbnid. “With the utmost venera-
tion.” Caerimonz'a properly refers to the rites and ceremonies o·f
religion3 here, however, it denotes the feeling of religious rever-
ence entertained toward a place in which solemn rites are accus-
tomed to be performed. Compare Wolf, ad Suet„ Vit. σωκ, c. 6,
as cited by Bremi—Inde. ‘⁶ From this.” Equivalent to ex hoc loco.
—Eum in sidem rhEpEric. “Received him into his protection.”
Fides properly means the confidence or trust thch we repose in
another; and then, as in the present instance, the result of that
confidence, namely, protection.-—Quam praestitit. “And this (pro-
tection) he made good,” z‘. e„ and he actually rendered the protec-
tion which he promised. We have placed a colon aster reciperet,

with Bremi and Klotz.

has again the meaning of ‘⁴ but.”— Ue consult-rec sibi. “To consult

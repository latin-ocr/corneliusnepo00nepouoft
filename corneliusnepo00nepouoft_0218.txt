manner, but one devoid os all judgment.” Demens denotes a want
osjudgment in particular cases. fimens is much stronger, and de-
notes a total want os reason—Non enim mbres patrios, διο. Nepos
nere is in error as to the time. Pausanias had abandoned the simple
manners of his country, and had adopted the Median attire and ori-
ental luxury, aster the receipt of the king’s answer and prior to his
first recalL—Cultum. ‘⁴ His mode osliving.’' It is osten, as Bremi
remarks, joined to another word, as in the present instance, and
then denotes all that belongs to a person’s mode os living, except

v what the added word denotes; hence here it includes his table, his

tent, his furniture, his state, διο.

Apparcilzt regio. “The equipage osa king.''— Veste Medica. Me-
dian, not Persian attire is meant. The Median dress was remarka-
ble sor its gorgeous magnificence, and consisted osa long, sull robe,
with flowing skirts, reaching to the ankles, and full, loose sleeves,
extending to the wrists ; it was accoinpanied also with ear-rings,
collars, and sometimes bracelets. The Persians, on the other hand,
were attired in a short tunic, reaching only to the knees, with long,
light sleeves, and the whole of the dress so close that not a sold
appears in the representatinus—Satellftcs Medi, &o Thucydides
says that these accompanied him when he went forth from Byzan-
tium and made a journey through Thrace—Qui aderaut. “They
who were present.” His guests and table companions are meant.

Aditum petentibus, διο. “He granted no access of waiting upon
him to those who sought sor it,'' 2'. ε., he granted no access to those
who desired to wait upon him. After petentibus we must supply, in
strictness‚ aditum—Spartam redire ualebat. Nepos now returns to
the correct order os the narrative. What immediately precedes
belongs, as already remarked, to his first residence at Byzantium,
before he was recalled tho first time—colonas. Colonae was a city
os Troas, on the coast, just below Alexandrea Troas. Pausanias
betook himselsto Colonae on being compelled hythe Greeks to leave
Byzantium. (Tkucyd, i.‚ 131.)-In agro Τνοᾶάε. Observe that
Troade here is not an adjective, sor then it would be seminine3 but
a noun, in apposition with agra—Quum patrioe, tum sibi. “Both to
his country, and more particularly to himself.” In the construction
quum . . . . eum, greater importance is always attached to the second
part, and hence tum must be rendered by “ and particularly‚'’ ‘⁶ and
more particularly,'' &c (Zumpt, <x 723.)

Vincula epistolae laxavit, διο. “ Loosened the string os the letter,
and the scal being (in this way) taken off.” Letters among the an-
cients were usually written on tablets covered with wax, which
were then put together in the sorm of a little book, and tied around
with a string. A seal of wax, or a species of earth used sor this
purpose, was then placed upon the knot where the two ends of the
string were tied. This scal was made by the impress of the signet-
ring. On the present occasion, according to the account os Nepos,
the Argilian manages to loosen the string without untying it, and
then pulls it off the letter with the seal remaining entire on the
kn0t‚ in order that he might restore matters to their former state
in case he should find his suspicions to be groundless. Thucydides,
in his version of the same story, makes the Argilian to have pre
pared a counterseit seal‚ and to have broken open the letter.-— Cog
novit. ‘⁴ He learned‚’' i. e.‚ by a perusal ofthe contents. The letter,
like all the previous oneS, contained directions to Artabazus to put
the bearer to death.

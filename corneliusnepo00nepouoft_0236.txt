Athenians, so now, aster they had gone over to them, they would
prove very firm friends—Pervenere. “To destroy.” Analogous to
the Greek ὁιαπέρθειν. The prepositions here, both in Greek and
Latin, signisy literally, “through and through,'’ i. e., utterly, entirely.

wanting here in the MSS. We are not told, namely, by Nepos, how
Lysander deceived the Thasians. The particulars are surnished

themselves perfectly safe, he suddenly fell upon them with a body
of troops and put them to death.

meant. The success and fame os Lysander had excited jealousy
and perhaps alarm in several of the leading men at Sparta. Even
the kings and ephori felt themselves reduced to comparative insig-
nificance by his side. Hence the movements made to thwart him.

“By which provocation being fired.” Observe that dolore, which
properly expresses the feeling, is here put for the cause theh pro-

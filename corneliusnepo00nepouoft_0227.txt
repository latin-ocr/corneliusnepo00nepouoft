pare Vit. lerasyb„ chapter i., ᾧ 4.- Versatussuerat. ‘¹ He had been.'’

serve that potestas here denotes legitimate “ control,'' and is opposed
to potencia.

Imperator. “As commander (os the Athenian forces).’⁷—Apud
flumen Strymona. Nepos alludes to the capture of the city of Eion,
on the River Strymon, in Thrace, B.C. 476. This town, which was
very important to the Persians, was desperately defended by the
garrison under the command of Boges‚ who had been shut up in the
place aster having been defeated by Cimon under its walls. The
Thracians in the vicinity, who supplied the town with provisions,
were also defeated by him. Boges‚ rather than surrender the city,
set fire to it, and perished in the flames with his family and all his
substance—Oppidum Amphipolim constituit. “Founded the town
of Amphipolis.” According to Plutarch, Cimon, finding that Eion,
now reduced to a heap of ruins, was not worth retaining, settled the
country about it, which was very beautiful and fertile, with Athe-
nian colonists. Amphipolis is included under this, the distance be-
tween the two places being not more than twenty-five stadia. Am-
phipolis was so called because surrounded by the waters of the Stry-
mon (ἀμφί, “ around,'' and πόλις, “a city''). As regards the accu-
sative in im, consult Zumpt, o 62.

In coloniam. ‘⁶ F01 a colony.'’ The preposition in is here em-
ployed, like the Greek ὲπί, to denote the object or dessign—Apud
Mycalen. ‘⁸ At Mycale.‘’ The battle here meant was fought at the
River Eurymedon in Pamphylia, Bc. 406. On the other hand,
Mycale was a promontory of Ionia in Asia Minor, opposite Samos,
and the battle fought there took place in B.C. 479, thirteen years
before. Nepos therefore appears to have committed here a grave
historical error, unless we suppose, with Tzschucke, that there was
a second and obscurer Mycale near the Eurymedon in Pamphylia,
which is very improbable-Demeam cepit. “ Conquered and took.”
Elegant Latinity for devicit ct cepit. Plutarch gives a different ac-
count of the number of the barbarian vessels.

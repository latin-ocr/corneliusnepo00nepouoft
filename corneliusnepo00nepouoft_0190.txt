Alienus properly denotes what belongs to another, what is identified
with his interests, and therefore, What is favorable sor him, and un-
savorable sor us. The narrow strait osSalamis might well be called
a most unsavorable position sor the Persians, since it rendered their
overwhelming superiority in numbers coniparatively valucless‚ only
a certain number of vessels being able to meet the Greeks at a
time, and the rest being crowded together in confusion, and unable
to perform any movement osimportance.--Adeo angusto mari. “In
so narrow a sea.⁷'—Expliccz2·i non potufirz't. “Could not be drawn

Hic. Referring to Xerxes—Tantas habebat reliquias copiarum.
Xerxes had still the means os renewing the contest with a greatly
superior force, and the aspect he assumed led the Greeks to suppose
that he would not be deterrcd by liis defeat from prosecuting his
enterprise with even greater vigor. Ile began to make preparations
sor throwing a bridge or causcway over the narrowest part of the
strait by sastening some Phoenician mcrchantmen together. But
this threatening attitude was only a seint to conceal his real scel-
ings and intentions, and he soon began his retreat—Ioemm ab eodem
gradu depulsus est. ‘A second time was lie driven from his posi-
tion by the same individual‚” i. c.‚ by Themistocles. Observc that
codem does not agree with gradu. The expression depellere aliquem
gradu is a military one, and means to drive an opponent from a po-
sition which he has taken. The distinction between iterum and
rursus must be noted. The former is strictly ⁴¹ a second time ;'' the
latter is simply ⁴* again‚” aud iuzss( be the third or iburth time.

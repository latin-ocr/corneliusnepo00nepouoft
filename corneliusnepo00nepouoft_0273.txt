Artaxerxe. Artaxerxes Mnemon. The rupture between the Spar-
tans and the King of Persia arose from the attempt made by Tissa-
phernes to bring under his control as satrap the Greek cities of Ionia.
They had provoked his displeasure hythe preference which they had
shown for Cyrus, and they applied, in consequence, to the Spartan
government for aid, regarding this as the acknowlcdged head of the
Greek natium—Agesilaumque bellacum misissem, ἀς.. This was the
celebrated Agesilaus, one of the kings os Sparta, whose biography
is given by Nepos sarther on. Thimbron had first been sent, then
Dercyllidas. Agesilaus was the third in order.

Maxime impulsi a Tissapherne, διο. Another grave error on the part
of Nepos, not only consounding the times of events, but also directly
at variance with the truth. The Lacedaemonians were not impelled
to the war by Tissaphernes, *neither had the latter revolted from the
king or made any alliance with them. The motive which induced
the Spartans to take up arms against Persia has already been stated
by us, namely, a wish to protect the independence ofthe Greek cities
in Asia Minor against the encroachments os Tissaphernes. It was
against Tissaphernes, moreover, that all the operations of Agesilaus
were conducted. After repeated disasters‚ Tissaphernes was finally
accused of treachery by his countrymen, although no one had lost
more by the Greek invasion than himself. Still, however, his con-
duct afforded some pretext for such an accusation, and the complaints
it excited were carried up to the court, where he had one implacable
enemy in the fiendish Parysatis, who thirsted to revenge herself on
him for his enmity to her favorite son, the younger Cyrusv Pary-
satis obtained from the weak Artaxerxes an order to have Tissa-
phernes put to death, and he was surprised and assassinated while
in the bath. Nepos consounds all these events together, takes sor
granted the truth of the charges brought against Tissaphernes, an-
tedates the whole affair, and transforms the antagonist of Agesilaus
into an ally and friend! (Compare lez'rlwall, Hist. Gr„ c. xxxv.)

Hunc adversus, διο. “ Pharnabazus was accounted the command-
er against him‚⁷’ i. ε., was the nominal commander-in·chief. In
what is herc said of Pharnabazus and Conon acting against Agesi
laus, Nepos has committed another error. The operations of these
two commanders were naval ones, and not carried on by land. And

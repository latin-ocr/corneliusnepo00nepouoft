Simultatis. “ Of the misunderstanding.'’—Primis temporibus.
“During the first periods (os the new reign).'’—Simulata amicitia.
‘⁴ A pretended sriendship.'’—Quumque Dzon non desisceret, &c This,
which Nepos makes Plato's third visit, was, in fact, the second.—

Philiscum. Philistus was an eminent historian os anfiquity, none
of whose works, however, have reached us. He stood at first high
in favor with Dionysius the Elder, but having offended him by mar-
rying without his consent one of the daughters os his brother Lep·
tines, he was, in consequence, banished from Sicily. The younger
Dionysius recalled him, having been urged to this step by those who
wished to counteract, through his means, the influence os Dion and
Plato. After his recall, he not only caused Plato to be sent back to
Athens, bnt succeeded in effecting the banishment of Dion also.—
Hominem amicum, &c. “A man not more a friend to the tyrant than
to tyranny itsels.”—In co mco libro. “ In that work of mine.” Meo
is wanting in some MSS. The work referred to is lost.

Plato atatem tantum, &c. ‘⁴ Plato, however, was able to effect so
much with Dionysius, by his personal influence.‚ and prevailed so
much by his eloquence,‘’ ἀα--Τμναηπῑιίίε facere finem, &c. Com-
pare with this the statement made by Plutarch in his lise os Dion
(c. 13), that, on the occasion osa solemn sacrifice, when the herald
had prayed, as usual, sor the long continuance os the government,
Dionysius exclaimed, “ Wilt thou not cease uttering imprecations
upon usu—A qua voluntale, διο. “ Being deterred from pursuing
which intention‚‘' &c.

transfers himself to the time at which the letter is read by the per-
son to whom it is addressed‚ and hence the writer speaks of actions
and conditions in the same terms as he would use if he were pres-
ent at the moment the letter is received. In consequence of this,
he frequently uses the imperfect and perfect, where in English we
should use the present. (Zumpt, ζ) 503.)—Om⁷1ium Graiorum. The
genitive here depends on the partitive qui. (Zumpt, ᾧ 429.)-In
domum tuam. “Upon thy house‚'’ i. e., thy line or family. The term
domus is employed in this sense only when distinguished persons
are referred t0.—-Quum milti neccsse suit. Observe that quum in
the sense of‘1whi1e” takes the perfect or imperfect indicative.

Idem. “ Ι, the same.'' More sreely‚ “I also.‘'-Rursus. “On
the other nand.'' Equivalent here to contra. A similar usage pre-
vails in the case os the Greek αὖ and affice—Feci. Supply illi.—
Postquam in tuto ipse. “After Ι myself was in sasety.'’ The ex·

in tutum pervenerunt.’'—Ille. Xerxes—Litteris cum certiorem feci.

the plural with numerals, consult Zumpt, ᾧ 119, Herodotus (viii,
110) says that the message sent to Xerxes was a verbal, not a writ-
ten one.—Id agri, &o Compare chapter v.‚ ᾧ l.—Atquc ab hostibus
circumiretur. The subject is changed. With dissolveretur it is pons,-

sense os confagio. Compare note on veni, <) 2.—Ezagicams α cuncte}
Groecz'ci. “Driven out by all Greece.'' Exagitams is a term bor-
rowed from hunting operations, and properly means “ chased out‚'
or driven out like some wild beast that can nowhere find security
or quiet. cuncta also is a sorcible term here, the idea being that
all Greece is combined, as it were, against him; for cunctus (equiv-
alent to conjunctus) means “all taken together‚'’ “all combined.’'
—Non minus me bonum amicum, &a ‘¹ Thou wilt have me a no less
good friend than he found me a gallant enemy.'‘ Inimicus is, prop-

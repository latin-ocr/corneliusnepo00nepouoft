by verbal nouns in io os the third deciension. They occur more
frequently, however, in writers of a later age. One of the MSS.

This, however, savors os the copyist-Culpa: suae tribuebant. “They
imputed to their own sault.’⁷—Quod expulissent. The subjunctive,
as eonveying the sentiments os the peopIe—Id arbitrari. ‘⁴ To think
so.”—P0scquam coeperat . . . . potuerant. The plupersect is here em-

these games. or else we must refer the words nisi Olympiae victoribus

any reference to the material os which the crowns themselves were
made.- Coronis aurcis oencz'squc, διο. The meaning is, that all
without distinction, both high and low, presented him with crowns,

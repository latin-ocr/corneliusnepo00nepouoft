§a

Fiebat. “It used to happen.” Observe the force of the imper-
fect in denoting an oft-repeated action.— Quotiescumque prodisset.
“ As osten as he went sorth.’' Literally, “ as osten as he might have
gone forth.” The Latin idiom, as we have already remarked, is
more precise in such cases than the English, since the former de-
fines the time os an action that must be completed before another
begins. (Arnold, ad loc.) The subjunctive, moreover‚ is required
in prodisset, from the circumstance os the time's being lest uncertain
and indefinita—Neque ei par quisquam poneretur. “Nor was any
one counted equal to him.'' Literally, ‘⁸ nor was any one put down
as equal,” δια, z'. e., put down as in making enu1nerations.—Itaque
non solum spem, &Q “ Wherefore they had not only the greatest
hopes in him, but also entertained an apprehension (of him).‘’ We
can say in Latin habere spem in aliquo, but not habere timorem in ali-
quo, so that, strictly speaking, we must regard habebant here as an
instance of zeugma, and consider timorem as equivalent to timorem
ejus.

Adspergebatur etiam infamia. “ He was sullied also by evil re-
port.'’ Literally, 0‘ was besprinkled or bespattered.‘’—-Faeere mys-
teria dicebatur. Alcibiades was charged with having sometimes, in
a circle of his most intimate companions, celebrated a kind of pro-
fane and intemperate orgies, in mockery of the Eleusinian mysteries.
——Dicebatur. Observa that the indicative is here employed because
an historical saet is stated by Nepos—Non ad religionem, sed ad eon-
jurationem perttrzEre. ‘·‘ To have reference not to religion, but to con-
spiracy,” i. e., not so much to concern religion, as to be a proof of
a conspiracy’s having been formed against the state.

CHAPTERIV.
or

Hoc crimine compellabatur. “ He was openly charged with this
crime.’' For the construction of the ablative here, consult Zumpt,
0446. The text does not mean that any formal accusation was
brought against him, but merely that he was charged with the os-
sence in the speeclies made by his accuscrs before the people. The
verb compellare means, properly, “ to address one,” and particularly
in a loud and harsh manner, indicative of an intention to give future
trouble to the party. (Bi-cmi, ad loc.)—-Instabat. “Was drawing

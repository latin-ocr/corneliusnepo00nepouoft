Quo nitigis. “ On which account the more.'’-—Praeceplum. ‘⁴ Max-
im.·’—Ncc sine causa dici, &e “And that it is not said without
reason that the mother os a cautious person is not accustomed to
weep.'’ By timidus is here meant, not a coward‚ but one who is

Pro opinione. “According to his expectations.'‘ The remark
here made by Nepos respecting the slow increase os the forces of
Thrasybulus is not correct. According to Diodorus Siculus (ΚΝ,
33), that leader soon had twelve hundred men under his command,
with which he descended from Phyle and marched by night into the
Piraeeus, where he found the whole population of the place ready to
aid him.-Jam tum illis temporibus. Either tum or illis temporibus
is superfluous here. Two particles, or expressions of time, how-
ever, are often brought together in this way, for purposes of em
phasis, where one would have been sufficient—Fortius boni pro li-
bertate, &c A sneer at the want of spirit in his own days. What
was prevalent in the time of the writer is thus spoken of as pre-
vailing also in the tIme of Thrasybulus.

Piraeeum. The Piraeeus, as already remarked, was the main har-
bor of Athens, and a town of itselfi—Munychiam. Munychia aud
Phalerum formed the two minor ports of Athens. Strabo describes
Munychia as a peninsular hill, connected with the continent by a nar-
row neck os land. When it had been inclosed by sortified lines, con-
necting it with the other ports, it became a most important station.
—Adori sunt. ‘⁴ Attempted.” On this usage os adorior with the
infinitive, consult Ernesti, Gloss. Liv.‚ s. υ. adorior-,- and also Bremi’s
note on the present passage—Ab ca. ‘⁴ From it.”

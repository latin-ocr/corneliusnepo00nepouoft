Harum rerum nullum erat, &tm “There was no open charge
(against him) as to these things‚'’ i. e., no overt act on his part as
sar as these matters were concerned, on which any direct charge
could be grounded. The ephori had received information, however,
from some os the Helots themselves, os the treasonable designs os
Pausanias; but they exercised their usual caution in requiring un-
questionable prooss before they proceeded to extremities in the case
osso distinguished a man—Non putabant oportere. Observe the pe-
culiar and emphatic position os the negative. The ordinary ar-
rangement would be putabant non oportere. Similar instances, how-
ever, are not unfrequent in the best writers. Thus, in Cicero (De
San„ xx, 7), we have “non censet lugendam csse mortem ,·'’ and in
Livy (iii.‚ 41), “mm crit melius vocem misisse.⁷'—Et exspectandum.
The Latins not unfrequentlyjoined an affirmative clause in this way
to a negative one which has preceded ; in which case, ec, atquc, que.
ac, may be translated by the English ‘⁴ but.'’ (Daclme, ad loc. Com-
pare Vic. Milc„ chapter ii., ς) 5; Vit. Themisc„ chapter viii.‚ ᾧ 5, dcc.)

the accusative of a noun, to express more particularly the com-

&e-Quod . . . . rediisset. The subjunctive, as marking the thoughts
of the Argiuam—Super tali causti. “On such an account.” The
preposition super has in prose the ablative only when used in the
sense osde; but chiefly in writers os the Silver Age osthe language.

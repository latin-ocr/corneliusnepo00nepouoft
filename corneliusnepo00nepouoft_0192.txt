Phalerico portu. ‘⁴ The Phaleric harbor,” i. e., the harbor os Pha-
lerum. This was the most ancient os the Athenian portS, and gave
name to the adjacent borough. Some editions have Phalereo, in-
correctly, however, since Phalericus relates to things, but Phalereus
to persons—Triplex Piroeei portus constitutus cst. “The triple har-
bor os the Piraeeus was constructed.'‘ The Piraeeus was a celebrated
and capacious harbor at some distance from Athens, but connected
with it by means of the ‘⁴ Long Vt⁷alls‚’' as they were termed. It
contained three large basins, named Οαηιήᾶνοε, Aphrodision, and
an, and hence the epithet triplex in the text-Circumddeus. ‘⁶ WVas
surrounded.’' Supply cst. We ean either say circumdo alicui cus-
todias, or circumdo aliquem custodiis, and, consequently, in the pass-
ive voice, custodite tibi circumdantur, οι· tu circumdaris custodiis.
(Zumpt, <) 418.)—Dignz'taec. “ In imposing appearance.'’ Dignitas,
as Bremi remarks, is that kind of external beauty and splendor
which gives rise to a feeling of wonder and respect.

Muros. These had been destroyed by the barbarians.—Praecipuc
periculo suo. ‘⁴ At his own particular hazard.”-Causam idoneam.

“ A fitting pretence.”—Qud negarent. “By virtue ofwhich to deny.’'
After the adjectives dignus, indignus, aptus, and idoneus, the relatives
are commonly used with the subjunctive—Extra Peloponnesum.
‘⁶ VVithout the Peloponnesus.⁷' By the Peloponnesus is meant the
southern part of Greece, below the Isthmus os Corinth, and com-
prising the countries of Achaia, Elis, Arcadia, Messenia, Laconia,
Argolis, and the Corinthian territory.—Loca munita. “So many
fortified plaees,” i. e., strongholds.—Aehcnienscs ‘edificantes prohibEre.
“To hinder the Athenians in building (their walls),'’ AEdificantes
here expresses the idea os building as a general one, without any
reference either to a beginning or a continuing osthe same. The
reference to time must not be pressed here in translating the parti·
ciple, since, isthis be done, the meaning will be ‘⁴ while in the act of
building,’' whereas it appears from ᾧ 4 that they had not yet begun
to build. If we wish to eonvey the idea that the Laeedaemonians
endeavored to stop the beginning or sartlzcr prosecution of the build—
ing‚ we must, in place of edificantes, use the form ne or quo miuus
adficerent.

daemonians‚ and stands for ipsis. This is one of the peculiarities of
Nepos—Quare oequum csse, &a The usual construction of coquum
cst is with the accusative and infinitive. Sometimes, however,
we have ut with the subjunctive. (Zumpt, ᾧ 600, <> 623.)—Illos.
Referring to ephoros, the more distant term, just as his refers to

Lacedaemoniorum, the nearer.—Quz'buss{dcs haberetur. “ Unto whom
credit might be given,’' i. ε., who could be relied upon. The ex-

pressionsidem habere alicui means, ⁴⁴ to repose trust or confidence in
one,’' “to believe what he says.’⁷——Qnt rem explorarent. “To ex-
amine into the affair.’' Qui again equivalent to ut, and hence the
subjunctive.

Gestus esc ei mos. ‘⁴ His wish was complied with.'' In the ex-
pression gerere morem alicui, the term mos means a person’s will or
humor, and hence the phrase means, ‘⁴ to gratify a person by doing
his will‚'’ “to comply with one's wishes,'' “to grant his request.’'
It is equivalent‚ in fact, to “ suum morem ad alienum accommodaro.'’-—
Functi summis honoribus. “W'ho had discharged the highest offi-
ces.'' On the construction osszcngor, consult Zumpt, §twa—Etsquc
praedizit. “And charged them.’' In many cases the force ofprae
in praedico does not sully appear in translating, but the reference is
rather to earnestness and strictness os injunction. Compare Bromi,
ad loc. Observe‚ moreover‚ that praedico, in the sense of charging
or enjoining, takes uc with the subjunctive, like verbs os command-
ing. (Zumpt, ᾧ 615.)- Ut πε dimitterent. “ On no consideration to
send away.’' The form uc ne is a pleonasm, not differing percepti-
bly from ne, except that it chiefly occurs in solemn or energetic dis-
course, and hence especially in laws, or in matters os serious in-
junction‚ as in the present instance—Prius . . . . quam. Tmesis.

Hos postquam Athenas, &c. “When he thought that these had
come to Athens.”—Ad magistratum senatumque, &c. ‘⁴ To the mag
istracy and senate of the Lacedaemonians.” Nepos here imitatos
the Roman form of expression. By magistratum is here meant, no
an individual magistrate, but the whole board or college os the
ephori. The Spartan senate was called γερουσία, or the Assembly
of Elders, and was the aristocratic clement of the Spartan polity.
Including the two kings, its presidents, it consisted os thirty mem-
bers. The senators were called γέροντες, “ elders,’' and held their
office sor lise.—Liberrimc professus ese. “Very frankly declared.’¹

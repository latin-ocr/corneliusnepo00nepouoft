Fama. Several MSS. havc flamma, which has been received by
many editors. But flamma has something harsh and unnatural here.
—Classiarii. “These on board the fleet.‘’ The nominative pre-
cedes quum here, and thus becomes more prominent. Compare
note on “ ca: his Ρᾶνιινη insulam,'’ Vit. ΜιἸΛ, vii„ ᾧ 2.- Ut diimbs
suas, &c. ‘⁶ That they should each depart to their respective homes.'’
This statement is not accurate. Some os the commanders, indeed,
are said to have left the council of war, and to havc made prepara-
tions for an immediate retreat. Those who remained behind, how·
ever, came to the resolution merely of retiring from Salamis, and
giving battle near the shore of the Isthmus of Corinth. Observe
that domos and discedet-ent are in the plural, because· there is a plural
reference in quisque. As regards the position ofsuas before quisque,
consult Zumpt, ᾧ 800.

Et universos pares esse aiebat. “And affirmed that all together
could be a match (sor the foe)‚” i. e., that, with united forces, they
would prove a match for them. Observe the force of universos as
opposed to dispersos. The imperfect aiebat denotes that he affirmed
this again and again. The same remark will apply to testabatur and
affirmabat.—Tcstabatur. ‘⁴ He assured them positively.’' Testari
here has the meaning of“ to assert a thing with the utmost confi-
dence, as if you had it in your power to produce the most undoubted
witnesses to its truth.’'—quue Eurybiadi, &c. ⁴⁸ And solemnly de-
clared unto Eurybiades‚ δια, that this will be the case.‘' There is
a species os climax in the three verbs aicbat, testabatur, affirmabat.
We have given the last of these the meaning assigned to it by
Daehne: “Affirmo, ich versichere hcilig (durch Εἰᾱ), schwiirc zust—
Regi Lacedaemaniorum. Another error on the part of our author.
Eurybiades was not a king of the Lacedaemoniam, nor was he even
of the blood royal.——Qui tum summae imperii preferat. A Spartan had
been appointed to the supreme command, by the desire of the allies
who refused to obey an Athenian.

Minus quam vellet. We have vellet here in the subjunctive, be-
cause it refers to what was passing in the mind of Themistocles.
-—Noctu de servis suis, quem habuit, &c “ He sent unto the king, by
night, the most faithful one that he had of his slaves.” Literally,
“ (one) of his slaves whom he had most faithful.'‘ The preposition
de with the ablative is osten used partitively‚ where we might have
had the preposition e or ez, or else the partitive genitive. (Zumpt.

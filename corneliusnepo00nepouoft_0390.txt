CHAPTER. IV.
ᾧ 1.

Secunda fortuna. “ With prosperous fortune.’‘ Previous to this
time the Carthaginians do not appear to have had any dominion in
the interior of Spain, though Gades and other Phoenician colonies
gave them, in some measure, the command os the southern coasts ;
but Hamilcar carried his arms into the beart of the country, and
while he reduced some cities and tribes by force os arms, gained
over others by negotiation, and availed himself of their services as
allies or mercenaries. The vast wealth he is said to have acquired
by his victories was probably derived, not only from the plunder and
contributions os the vanquished nations‚ but from the rich silver
mines in part ofthe country which he subdued.

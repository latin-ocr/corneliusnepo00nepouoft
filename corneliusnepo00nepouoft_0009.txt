ΤΗΕ popularity of Cornelius Nepos as ι text-book
for schools would appear, by this time, 11) be suffi-
ciently well established. It certainly forms a very
attractive work for the younger class of students,
but there is need, at the same time, of great care be-
ing exercised as regards many of the historical and
geographical details, which are either carelessly or in-
correctly stated 3 to say nothing of certain questions
of Latinity that oecasionally arise. It is with espe-
0101 reference to these matters that the present edi-
tion has been prepared3 and it is hoped that the at-
tempt has proved so sar successful, that the work of
Nepos may now be placed in the hands of the young
student without any danger of his imbibing from its
perusal confused and erroneous notions relative to
many important points of history, chronology, and
geography. It is surprising‚ indeed, to see, among
the numerous editions of Nepos published for the use
of 30110013, how very few contain any corrections what-
ever of the writer’s misstatcments. None of the edi-
tions that have thus sar appeared with English notes
seem, so sar as they have fallen under the editor-'s
personal observation, to have 1011011( any express notice
of these various discrepancics3 and the 301110 charge

applies equally 11011 to many of tlie school editions
that havo appeared even in Germany.

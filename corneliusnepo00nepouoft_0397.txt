right bank ofthe Aufidus, just below the town of Cannae. Between
sorty and fifty thousand of the Roman army are said to have fallen
in the field, among whom were the consul AEmilius Paulus, both
the consuls os the preceding year (not one merely, as Nepos states),
the late master of the horse, Minucius, above eighty senators, and
a multitude of wealthy knights who composed the Roman cavalry.
The other consul, Varro, escaped with a sew horsemen to Venusia,
and a small band osresolute men forced their way from the Roman
camp to Canusium. All the rest were killed, dispersed, or taken
prisoners.

CHAPTER V.
ᾧ l.

Romam profectus est. Erroneous. Hannibal did not march to
Rome immediately aster the battle os Cannae. He marched into
Campania with the main body of his army, and went into winter
quarters at Capua. This was the chief city os Campania, and
scarcely inferior in importance to Rome itself. Its gates were
opened to him by the popular party. Hannibal did not march to
Rome until the next year, B.C. 215, when Capua was bloekaded by
Q. Fulvius. He pitched his camp in the immediate neighborhood
os Rome, near the Colline gate. But when Fulvius, having lest the
siege of Capua to another commander, arrived and offered battle,
Hannibal declined it, and, having satisfied himself with ravaging the
country, returned to Campania, and thence to Rhegium—In propin-
quis urbis, διο. The genitive urbis here depends on menalius—Rc-
vereerelur Capuam. Not to Capua, which was still besieged by a
Roman army. He lest the city to its sate—Q. Fabius Maximus, &c
Another error. The affair here alluded to happened long before,
when Hannibal, aster the battle of Trasimenus, wishing to reach the
town of Casinum, was led by a mistake ofhis guide to Casilinum.
—Dictac0r. The “dictator” was an extraordinary officer, nomina-
ted in times of great danger, and invested with absolute authority.
His power, however, lasted only for six months. He had an os-
ficer under him called Magister Equitum, “master os the horse‚’'

· and who commanded the cavalry—In agro Falerno. “ In the Faler-

nian district.⁷’ A district in the north of Campania, extending from
the Massic Hills to the River Vulturnus, and remarkable for its
fine wine.

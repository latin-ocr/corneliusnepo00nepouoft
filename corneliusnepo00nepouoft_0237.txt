lege of surnishing kings sor Sparta, and to cause the kings to be
elected from the worthiest citizens. On these revolutionary pro.
jects os Lysander, consult the remarks of Thirlwall, in the Appendix
to the fourth volume os his History of Greece, p. 461, seqq-Tollere.
We would expect here tollendi after consilia, but zniz't consilia has
the soree osmcdz'tatus cst, and hence may take the infinitive (Brcmi,
ad loc.)-C'ons125v5ranb. “ W’ere accustomed.’' consuevi is “I am
accustomed” (i. e., I have become and so am aecustomed), and con-
sueveram, “I was accustomed‚” (i. e„ I had become and remained
accustomed). Compare the Greek εἴωθα and εἰώθειν.

Delphos. ‘⁵ Delphi,'’ i. e., the oracle at Delphi. The bribe would
be offered to the Pythoness and the priests os the temple. As re-
gards Delphi, compare notes on Vit. Milt„ chapter i., ί) 2.-Βοιίὀ7ιαιη,
“Dodona‚” i. e., the oracle at Dodona. This was the celebrated
oracle of Jupiter, in Epirus, on the declivity, or else at the base of
Mount Tamarus—Se vota suscepisse. ‘⁴ That he had made a vow.''
Literally, “that he had undertaken vows.’'—Quae Jovz' Hammbnz' sol-
υένει. “Which he was to pay to Jupiter Ammon.’' The subjunc-
tive here refers to the sentiments of the speaker, “ which he was
to pay (as he said).'’ Jupiter Ammon had a celebrated temple and
, oracle in the Oasis of Ammon, in the desert of Libya—Afros. The
prlests of the African or Libyan shrine are meant—Facilius corrup-
turum. “ Would more easily bribe.’'

ᾧ3.

Αηιὶείῐιεε. “The priests.'’ Used here in the general sense os
sacerdotes. Properly speaking, however, antistes means “a chief
priest,’' or “high priest,’' being derived from ante and sto, and de-
noting one who stands before or in advance os the rest.—Laccdaem5-
πᾶ. Greek form of the accusative—Quod conatus esset. “ Because
he had endeavored,’' z‘. e.‚ as they alleged; hence the subjunctive as
expressing their sentiments.

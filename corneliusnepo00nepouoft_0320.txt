CHAPTER IV.

ᾤ 1, 2.

Hic. “ In this posture ofaffairs.” Adverb.—Compararet. “He
was raising.”— Ut Aspim aggrederetur. “ (Directing him) to attack
Aspis.’‘ In the expression litterae sunt ei missae the notion ofa com-
mand is involved, and hence we must supply some word mentally
that indicates “directing,'' “telling,” &e Aspis was satrap of
Cataonia, and had revolted from the king—Tenebat. “WVas hold-
ing.”-Quae gens jacet. “This nation lies.” An unusual expres-
sion. After changing from the country to those who inhabited it,
Nepos nevertheless employs jacet, a word that can only be properly
used osa country—Coruinis Cappadociae. Cataonia, strictly speak-
ing, was merely a prefecture ef Cappadocia, in the southeastern part
os that country.

Castellisque munitam. Cataonia had no large towns, but several
strong mountain fortresses.--Non parebat. “Disobeyed.'' Non
prefixed to verbs frequently makes up with them a simple idea,
the exact reverse of the meaning of such verbs alone—Vezabat.
‘⁸ Harassed,” i. e.‚ by plundering and devastating incursions.—Qua
portarentur. ‘⁴ Which were from time to time carried.'' The sub-
junctive is here employed to indicate a repeated occurrence, where
in Greek we would have the relative with the optative. (Zumpt,
ζ) 569.)

ᾧ3,4.

Aberat. He was at Ace in Phoenicia, from which place he aster-
ward marched into Egypt. Compare chap. v., 1.—Majore re. “ A
matter ofmore importance‚” i. e., preparations for the Egyptian war.
—flsorcm gerendum. “That he must obey.⁷’ Supply csse sibi.—
campaneis, sed, &c. In such constructions quidem usually precedes
sed—Navem conscendit. “He went on board a vessel.''—Id quod.
WVlien a verb or a whole sentence is referred to, id quod is usually
found instead os quod. (Zumpt, κ) 371.)—Imprudc71tcm. “While
not aware (of his approach).‘’—Oppressurum. Supply esse—Quam-
vis magno exercitu. “With ever so great an army.’' Quamvis has
here the force ofquantumvis, and gives the positive magno a superla-
tive soree, as if the Latin were vel maz-imo exercitu.

Hac. Supply nave —Egrcssus inde. “Having gone out of it,’
i. ε.. having disembarked. Inde is equivalent here to e nava—Dic.»

This would be a clumsy arrangement—Arhbrung tractu. “ By the
row of trees (on either side).” Observe the force estractus here, as
implying that which is drawn out into a line or row more or less
emended—Ne clauderentur. ‘⁶ Lest they should be inclosed.’'

Non aequum locum suis. “That the place was not favorable sor
his men.‘' With locum supply esse. The adjective aequus has the
meaning of ‘⁶ favorable‚⁷’ sor the most part in negative clauses only,
like the present one. Opposed to it in this sense is alffinus—Fraus.
“ Relying upon.” Construed like dignus, δια, with the ablative.—
Cupiebac. “W'as desirous.⁷’ Observe the force of the imperfect
ln denoting continuance.—Sabsid2'0. “To their aid.” Supply illis.
On this construction with the double dative, consult Zumpt, ὁ 422.—
Venircnt. The subjunctive, because referring to what was passing
at the time in the mind ofDatis. (Zumpt, ᾧ 545.)-Ιη aciem. ⁴⁶ Into

imperfect subjunctive. So also in petierint, at the end of the sen-
tence. The principle has already been explained in the notes to
§2-Adeoque Δατενιεννιιὲνιιηι. “And to such a degree did they ter-
rify them.'’ Regularly‚ we should have here perterruem'nt, as ‹le-
pending on ut, in common with profligarint. The Latin writers,
however, not unfrequently, sor the sake of emphasis, make a sudden
change in the construction, and change a clause into a principal or
leading one that ought regularly to be a subordinate or dependent
oue—Qud pugna. The ablative os comparison.--Adhuc. “Up to
this time,” 2'. e., up to the time at which this was written by Nepos
The regular Latin form of expression would be usque: acl hoc tcmpua
'The term Ιιαειὲπιιε, which is commonly employed in this sense b)
later writers, never occurs with this meaning in Cicero, who always
keeps up the true distinction, name1y‚ using adhuc of time, and luw-
tenus of space—Prostrcivit. “Laid lOW,” z. e., utterly defeated.

F'rom prosterno. This is a much stronger term than prostigo, and

Pittacus ille. ‘⁶ The celebrated Pittacus.” Observe the force of
the demonstrative pronoun, designating him as a well-known and
celebrated individual. He was a native os Mytilene in the island
of Lesbos, and was one of those early cultivators of letters who
were known by the name of “ the Seven ivise Men of Greece.'‘-—-
Multa millia jzzgirum, ἀρ. The more usual Latinity would be mu-
neri, but the accusative munera is sometimes employed in apposi-
tion. Compare Vit. Hann„ chapter xii, ζ) 3. Observe‚ moreover,
that darent has here the meaning 0f“offered to give.'' The story
relative to Pittacus is as follows: In the conflict with the Atheni-
ans sor the possession of Sigaeum, on the coast of Troas, Pittacus
signalized himself by killing in single combat Phrynon, the com-
mander of the Athenians, an Olympio victor, celebrated for his
strength and courage. This seat Pittacus performed by entangling
his adversary in a net, and then dispatching him with a trident and
dagger, exaetly after the fashion in which the gladiators called Ra-
tiarii long afterward fought at Rome. For this achievement he re-
ceived from the Mytilenaeans high honors and substantial rewards 3
but os the latter he would accept only as much land as he could cast
his spear over, and this land he dedicated to sacred uses, and it
was known in later ages as “the Pittacean land.’‘ (Diog. Lacrt.‚
i.‚ 753 Herod„ v.‚ 94, seq.) The account which Nepos follows makes
mention merely of a hundred jugem—Invideant. '“May envy.”
The subjunctive here and in concupiscant is employed to sosten down
the assertion‚ and denotes mere possibility—Centum jugera. The
jugorum was a plot of two hundred and forty-eight feet by one liund-
red and twenty, and contained twenty eight thousand eight hundred
square feet—AEquitaccm. “The moderation.”—-Voluntatem. “Good
will.''—I⁷zdicent. The subjunctive again, sor the same reas< n as in
invideant and concupiscant which precede—Diutina. “ Lasting.'⁷-—
Propria. “Of long continuance.” More literally‚ “one's own,’'
i. e , being and remaining such.

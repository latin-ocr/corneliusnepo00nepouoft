Compare notes on chapter iii., 0 1.—-Ez sacellis sepulcrisque consta-
rent. “Consisted os temple· and grave-stones.'’ Literally, “os
chapels and sepulchres.” The productis here taken to express the
rude material. By sacella are meant, literally‚ small places conse-
crated to a deity, and containing an altar, and sometimes, also, a
statue. Here, however, by sacellis are meant temples generally.
Thucydides remarks that the walls os Athens plainly showed vesti-
ges of the haste with which they had been constructed, sor, as the
people urged on the work, they employed alike whatever came to

coming together.—Munilionis. “ Of the sortisying.‘’ Verbals in ic
strictly denote, as here, the aetion getting carried on. More com-
monly, however, they merely marl< the result.—Ad thfiros, διο.
“He went to the ephori of the LaeedaenioniansJ’ The ephori were
the chief magistrates at Sparta, and five in number. Their name in
Greek means “ overseers,'' and their prerogatives, in some respeets‚
encroached upon the royal authority. In fact, the kings, in the
course os time, became completely under their control—Panes quos

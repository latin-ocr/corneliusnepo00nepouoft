mon fleet.’‘ At the battle of Artemisium, the Grecian fleet con-⁴
sisted of two hundred and seventy-one triremes, os which one hund
red and twenty-seven were Athenian. At the battle of Salamis,
the combined fleet consisted of three hundred and eighty vessels¹
os which one hundred and eighty were Athenian. Nepos, as usual,
gives merely round numbers—Artemislum. By Artemisium is here
meant a long beach, on the northwestern coast os Euboea, commonly
called on maps “Artemisium lictus,‘’ and having in its vicinity e

manere. The fighting at Artemisium took place on three days in
succession. On the third day, when the combatants had been parted
by night and weariness, the Greeks, in consequence os the disabled
state os many os their ships, resolved to retreat. Their resolution
was confirmed the next day by the intelligence os the sall os Leoni-
das and the capture os the pass of Thermopylae.--Erat periculum.

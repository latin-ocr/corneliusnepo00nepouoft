persevering or active antagonist‚ and serves also tc mark an antith-
esis with amicum. Observe the construction, me being the accusa-
tive of the object, and amicum being in apposition with it. So in
the next clause, mc is to be supplied aster expertus cst, and forms an
apposition with inimicum—Quas tecum colloquivolo. ‘⁶ About which
1 wish to converse with thee.” The more usual construction would
be, de quibus tecum colloqui vola—Annum temporis. ‘⁸ A year's tinie.”
Literally, “ a year of time.'’ Some read annuum tempus, but without
any necessity. The genitive is occasionally added as a nearer defi-
nition osa noun ; the governed noun is the general, the governing one
the special term. Compare δαεεοηὶιιε, Vir. Caes„ c. 35, “Hieme αη-
m'.’' Themistocles desired that a year might be allowed him to ac-
quire the means of diselosing his plans in person—quue transacto.
“And that, after this is past.”—Patidrz's. Supply me from mihi in
the previous clause.

sermfinique Persarum. ‘⁴ To the literature and the language of the
Persians.” Litterae refers to the writings of the Persians, serm-o to
their spoken language. Themistocles, in order to acquire the Per-
sian language‚ read the works of Persian authors, aud conversed
with the naama—Multo commodius. ‘⁶ With far more propriety,”
i. e., in language sar more suitable to express the intended idea.
Literally, “more suitably,” or “fitly.''—Dicatur. As regards the
oresent here aster eruditus est, consult note on anteferatur, chapter
=., ᾧ 1.-Ηί qui in Perside crant nati. Daehne is correct in making
xhis a mere periphrasis sor Pcrsae. Nepos writes in his usual style
of exaggeration when-he makes Themistocles to have spoken the
Persian language, aster one year’s study, more eorrectly and ele-
gantly than the native Persians themselves. Thucydides gives a
sar more rational account, making him to have attained to all the
knowledge he could of the Persian language during that briesinter-
val, τῆς Περσίδος γλώσσης ὅσα ἠδύνατο, κατενόησε.

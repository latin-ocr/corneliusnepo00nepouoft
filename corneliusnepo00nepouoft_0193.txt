Hoc longe alio spectabat, &c “ This looked to a sar different ob-
Ject from what they wished should appear‚'⁷ i. e., their object in
making this suggestion was very different from the ostensible one.
Observe here the peculiar soree of atquc, which may be rendered
more literally by ‘⁴ than.'' Atque is used in this sense after adverbs
and adjectives denoting similarity or dissimilarity. (Zumpt, ᾧ 340.)
-Ιηῑείἰὶξένεηῐ, “WVere sensible.”—-Dc principatu. “For the su-
pre1nacy.” By principatus is here meant the first place among the
Grecian states, especially the chief command of the consederate
fleets and armies. This was called, in Greek, ἡγεμονία, or, as it is
sometimes expressed in English, the “ hegeniony.⁷’

Quam infirmissimos. “As weak as possible.”—Postquam autem
audierunt, &a “After they heard, however, that the walls were
getting prepared for erection.'’ We have given inscrz'tz' here its
strict and proper meaning, the reference being not so much to any
actual commencement of building, as rather to the collecting to-
gether and arrangement os materials. (Compare Brcmi, ad loc.)
As regards the employment ofpostquam with the perfect indicative,
where we would naturally expect the plupersect, consult Zumpt,
ζ) 506.-Quz' vetarent. The subjunctive, because the relative is here
equivalent to zat—Desierunt. “They desisted‚'' i. e.‚ srom collect-
ing materials and from their incipient attempts to build. Perfect
of desino, Era—Ad εοε. Referring to the Laeedaemonians.

Suscipit. “ Undertook.”-Primo. ‘⁴ First.''—Rcliquz' legati, &a
The order is, praecepit ut reliqui legati tum exirent, quum, &c.—-Praec5-
pit. “ He lest directions.”—Sacis exstructa. ‘⁶ Sufficiently advanc-
ed.'’—Int5rim omnes. Supply ut before omnes, from the previous
clause. There must be a comma also placed after omnes, which
then becomes a general expression, and is sarther defined by serm
atque libcrz'.——Opus sacErcnt. ⁴⁴ Should prosecute the work.”—-St'vc
. . . . sive. “Wlietlier. . . . or.” Sentences connected by sive . . . .
sive commonly have the verb in the indicative, unless there be a
special reason sor using the subjunctive. (Zumpt, ζ) 552.) In the
present case. the subjunctive indicates something hypothetical ; the
indicative, on the other hand, would imply an actual fact—Ec un-
dique congervrent. “But to get together from on all sides.'' Ob-

serve that ec has here, after a ΜἸξὶιῑίνε proposition, the force of sed.

Hasdrubale imperatore suffecto⁴ ‘⁴ Hasdrubal having been appoint-
ed commander in his stead.''—Equitalui omni praefuit. Hannibal
at this time was only eighteen years old. He had already displayed,
however, so much courage and capacity sor war, that he was in-
trusted by Hasdrubal with the chief command os most os the mili-
tary enterprises planned by that general—Hoc quoque interfecto.
He was assassinated by a slave whose master he bad put to death,
B.C. 22l.¹—Exercilus summam imperii, &a “The army conferred

tani in Hispania Tarraconensis, south os the Iberus, and about three
mues from the coast, on the River Palantias. Although south os
the Iberus, and therefore not included under the protection of the
treaty between Hasdrubal and the Romans, it hadrconcluded an al-
liance with the latter people. Hannibal laid siege to it in the spring
os B.C. 219, and only took it after a siege os eight months. This
was the immediate cause ofthe second Punic war.—Foedcratam civ-
itatem. “ An allied city,'’ i. ε., a city in alliance with the Romans.

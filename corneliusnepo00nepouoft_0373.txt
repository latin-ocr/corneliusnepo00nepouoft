Phocion, Atheniensis, &c Some editions have Phocion, Atheni*-
ensis, as a title, in accordance with the usual custom osNepos, and
commence a new sentence at etsi.—Nocior. Supply esc.—Rez' mili-
taris labor. “His labors in military affairs.’' More literally, “the
labor of his military service,” i. c., the effects or consequences of
his toils in the military service of his country—Memoria esc nulla.
The meaning is, no one, in speaking osPhocion, thinks ofthese, but
rather os his numerous virtues—Hujus. “Osthe latter.” Reser-
ring to rei militaris labor.—Illius autem magnasama. “ Osthe former,
however, the same is great.'’—Ex quo. “And from this circum-
stance,’' i. e.‚ because of the well-known uprightness oshis lise.—
Bonus. ‘⁶ The Good.'’ In Greek, ὁ Χρηστός.-Βε1αίο.ς. “ That had
been bestowed upon him.’'—Dabantur. ‘¹ Were given from time to
time.'' Observe the soree osthe imperfect.

A rege Philippo munera magna: Ρεεῑιηίιε. “Large presente of
money from King Philip.” A preposition with the ablative is some-
times employed in Latin to denote the source whence a thing pro-
ceeds, as here. More commonly, however, a participle is also ex-
pressed, which in the present case would have been missa—Horta-
rentur accipere. “WVere exhorting him to receive them.’' On the
infinitive with hortor, in place os ut with the subjunctive, consult
Zumpt, ὁ 615.—Prospz·ceret. ‘⁴ He should provide sor.⁷’—-In summa
paupertate. ‘⁶ In the depth of poverty.”-Mei similes. On the con-
'struction ofsimilis, consult notes on Dat„ ix„ 3.—Agellus. ‘⁸ Little

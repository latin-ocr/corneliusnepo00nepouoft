CHAPTER 111.

Quos quo facilius repellerent. “In order that they might repe]
these the more easily‚’' i. e., might repel the barbarians the more
easily, in case they renewed hostilities. The grammatical order is
as follows: Aristides delectus cst, qui constitueret quantum pecuniae
quoeque civitas daret, ad classes aedificandas, exercitusque comparandos,
quo facilius repellerent eos, διο. The common text makes this chap-
tel· commence with the words Ad classes oedficanda3‚ &e., and as
signs all that precedes to the close os the previous chapter. The
present arrangement, which is that of Duehne, Benecke, Freund⁷
Brund, and many other modern editors, is sar neater, and the chap-
ter begins much less abruptly.—Si sorte. “ Is, perchance‚” ι’. e.,
in case it should so happen that-Qui constituerit. ‘⁶ To determine.‘'
—Arbitrz'o. “ Decision.‘'— Quadringena et sexagena talenta, διο.
“Four hundred and sixty talents were brought together to Delos
every year,'' i. e., were contributed and brought to Delos. Accord-
ing to Plutarch, this contribution was increased nearly one third by
Pericles, since, at the beginning ofthe Peloponnesian war, the Athe-
nians received srom their allies six hundred talents3 and he adds,
that aster the death os Pericles, those who held the administration
raised it gradually to thirteen hundred. As regards the value os
the talent, consult notes on Vit. Mile, chapter vii„ a} 6. Observe,
moreover, that the distributive numerals are here employed because
the reference is to a sum paid each year—Delum. Not in Delum.

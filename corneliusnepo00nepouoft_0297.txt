LIFE OF D10N. 281

me„ 6 6. Kirchmann suspects that the sorum or agora os Syra-
cuse is here meant, (De Fun„ ii., 26.)—Elatus publice. “ Having
been buried at the public expense.⁷' We have connected together
these two words by means of the punctuation, with Heusinger and
Bremi. The common text ‘connects elatus with what precedes, but

in urbe celeberrimo loco clatus is not Latin.

It is difficult to form a correct estimate of the character os Dion,
from the accounts that have come down to us. Nepos would seem
to place his character in too unfavorable a light, while, on the other
hand, he would appear to have been praised rather too highly by
Plutarch and other ancient writers. It is admitted, even by his ad-
mirers, that he was a man of harsh and unyielding disposition, qual-
ities wh-ich would easily degenerate into despotism when he found
himself at the head of affairs. If he was sincere, in the first in-
stance, in his intention os restoring freedom t-0 Syracuse, he seems
to have afterward abandoned the idea3 but still it would be too much
to say that he intended to make himself an actual despot.

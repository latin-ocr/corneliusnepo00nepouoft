mum conscii essent—chersonesum reliquit. This is not correct.
Miltiades was lest in quiet possession os his principality sor several
years, though during that period a Persian soree was engaged in
military operations in his neighborhood. Considerable doubt, there-

fore, has been entertained respecting the whole story. Consult the
note at the end of this biography.-Cujns ratio, etsi non valuit.

‘⁴ WVhose proposition, although it did not prevail.'⁷—Amici0r. Gov-
erning the dative here as an adjective. When used as a noun, it
governs the genitive.

CHAPTER IV.
<s 1.

Darius autem. “ But Dan'usJ’ The conjunction autem is osten
employed, as here, to sosten down, in some degree, the abruptness
ofa transition—Quum redisset. He returned to Asia hythe bridge
of boats over the Thracian Bosporus, referred to in the notes on
chapter iii„ l.—Hortantibns amicis. “His friends exhorting him.'’
Ablative absolute. The person who was most urgent for the expe-
dition against Greece is said to have been Hippias, the banished
tyrant of Athens, who had fled for aid to Darius, and hoped to be
restored by the arms os Persia.—C'0mparavit. ‘⁶ Fitted out.'⁷ The
size os the armament is differently given by different writers. Plato

-ui, ἀρ.

force os an adjective, and is therefore construcd with the dative,
like amicior in the last section of the previous chapter. Hostis is a
public enemy; inimicus, a private foe—Iones Sardes expugnassent.
“ The Ionians had taken Sa1·des.’⁷ The verb expugnare means prop-
erly to drive the defenders os a place out of it by dint of fighting.
Sardes was the ancient capital of Lydia. Some editions give the
old accusative form Sardis. By Ιῡηεε are meant the Ionian Greeks,
who had settled at an early period in Asia Minor, along the shores
o‘f the AEgean Sea. They revolted srorn the Persian king, to whorn
they had long been subject; and a body 0s10nians‚ together with
some Athenians and Eretrians, marc-hod against Sardes, and took ‘
and burncd the place—Expugnasscnt. Thc subjunctive, because

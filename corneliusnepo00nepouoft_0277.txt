Id ut Lacedaemoniz's esc nunciatum, διο. Nepos makes the visit ot
Conon to the Persian court to have taken place aster the recall of
Agesilaus. It is more than probable, however, that it occurred pre·
vious to the expedition of the Spartan monarch, and that its object
was to urge those naval preparations of the Persian court, which
gave occasion to that very expedition—Non sinc curti. A litotes
sor magnei eumz—Cum barbaro solum. He means, with the Persian

Pisander. (Thirlwall, Hist. Gr., c. xxxv.)—Apud Cnidum. ‘⁴ Off
cnidus.” Cnidus was a town os Doris in Caria, at the extremity
of a promontory called Triopium. Pharnabazus and Conon were in
company, the former having the command of the Phoenician galleyS‚
while the Greek squadron remained under the immediate orders os
Conon. As they sailed westward along the coast of Syria, Conon's
squadron being some way abead, they sell in with Pisander's fleet
coming from Cnidus. According to Xenophon, Conon's squadron
alone was so much stronger than Pisander’s sscct as to spread dis-

XV. EPAMINONDAS.

CHAPTER I.
ζ) 1.

I'olymnz'. ‘⁵ Of Polymnis.” We have here the Latin form of the
genitive, as if from a nominative in us, although no such nomina-
tive exists. The father of Epaminondas was named Polymnis (116-
λυανις), tlrc regular genitive os which is Polymnidis (Πολύμνιδος).
Another form ofthe genitive would be Polymnis, like the nominative,
the change from which to Polymni would be an easy one. consult
notes on Themist., i.‚ 1, and also the remarks ofBremi, and compare
Zumpt, ᾧ 61, l.—Scribimus. The indicative is preferable here. The
common text has scribamus. Consult Zumpt, ᾧ 576.-Η(εσ proecipi-
enda videntur, &c “ The following things seem proper to be pre-
viously charged upon my readers,’' i. e., it seems right that 1 should
previously warn my readers—Ne alienos mores ad suos reserant.
“ That they refer not the customs of other nations to their own‚''
i. 6., judge not of them by the standard of their own-Qum ipsis lc·
viora sunt. ‘⁴ Which are os less estimation unto themselves,'’ i. a,
in their own eyes—Pari modosuisse. ‘⁶ To have been in like man-
ner (oflittle estimation).” Supply levia.

02, 3, 4.

Abesse a principis persona. “Is (far) away from the character or
a leader in the state,’' ι’. ει, is inconsistent with, or foreign to it.—
Principis. By principes are meant the leading and most ‹listin-
guishcd men in the state. Compare lecmist., viii.‚ 3.——Saltare vcro.
“That to dance, however.'' The infinitive used substantively, as
the subject of poni.—D11czmlur. “Are deemed.”—Exprimcre im-
aginem consuetudinis, διο. “ To draw a correct picture ofthe habits
and (modc of) life.‘’——Dchcre. ‘⁴ To owe it (to our readers).'’—Dis-
ciplinis. “Gourses osinst1·ucti0n.”——Ingcnii facultatibus. “Abih-
ties of mind.’'—P0slrcmo. This last-mentioned point Nepos has
sorgottcn to handle. What hc says os the activity of Epaminondas
is merely mentioued incidentally‚ when treating of the other points.
—Am'mi anteponuntur virtutibus. ‘¹ Are ranked before endowmeris

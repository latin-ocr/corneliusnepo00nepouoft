an action's being performed by a certain person. In the former
case, attention is called to a person in the act of doing a thing; in
the Latter, merely to the action of a particular person. (Zumpt,
<5 636.)—Quaesisse ab εο. The usual form of expression would bave
been quaesisse: ez co. Perhaps the preposition ab is here employed
to mark the air of calm indifference worn by Aristides, and the ab·
sence of all earnestness of manner.

Se ignorare Aristidem. “ That hc did not know Aristides‚'’ i. e.,
had never seen him to know him. The usual form of expression
would have been se uon nosse Aristidem. 'W'hen speaking of per-
sons, the verb ignorare is very seldom employed, and then generally
in the sense of not knowing any thing about one, which, of course,
would not suit the present passage—Quod . . . . elaborasset. The
subjunctive is here employed to mark the sentiments of the speaker.
—Praecer ceteros. ‘⁵ Beyond the rest‚'' i. e.‚ above all others.

Hic. The pronoun, referring to Themistocles—Non pertrita.
“ Did not suffer to the end.” More literally‚ ‘⁴ did not endure through-

have here again postquam with the perfect where we would natu-
rally expect the pluperfect. Compare Vit. Themisc„ chapter vi„
<j 4, and Zumpt, ᾧ 506.-Sezto scre anno, quam. Observe that quam
is here for postquam. This omission of post before quam occurs
particularly when pose or postquam has just preceded. Compare
Herzog, ad Caes., B. G., iit, 28, l.—Populiscilo in patriam resticulus
est. “He was restored to his country by a decrec of the people.”
Populi-scitum is from populns and scisco, scivi, scitum, sciscorc. Plu-
tarch says that this took place after Aristides had been three years
in exile, and not six years nearly, as Nepos states. The Athenians
recalled all their exiles before the battle of Salamis.

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

· Interfuit autem. ‘⁴ He was present, moreover, and took part in.''
Interesse is much stronger than adesse, which means merely to bc
present, without taking any part—Prius, qnam liberaretur. The ac-
count given by Plutarch, in his life of Aristides, is directly at vari-
auce with this, aud malies Aristides to have been recalled laesere the

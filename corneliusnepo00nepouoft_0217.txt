Plataea—Eum collaudat. “He praises him highly.⁷’ Collaudatis

aquivalent here to valde laudat, arising from the force of con in eom-
* position. Compare Vit. Agcs., i.‚ l.—-Ac petit, nc cui rei parcat.
‘¹ And requests him not to spare any thing.’' Cui sor alicui—Qum
polliceatur. Correet Latinity requires the subjunctive here, since
these words belong to Xerxes's message as related by Nepos, and
are not the expressions of Nepos himself. The common reading.
therefore, qaae pollicetur, is wrong, although Bremi seeks to defend
it by making it a circumlocution for promissa—Nullius rei a se rc-
pulsam latarum. ‘⁶ He will receive a refusal of nothing from him.’‘
Literally‚ “ he will bear away a resusal‚” &c

Hujus Pausanias voluntate cognita. ‘⁴ Pausanias, when the will-
ingness of this (monareh) had become known to him,'⁷ i. e., his
willingness to ‹zo-operate. Observe here the peeuliar position os
Pausanias, with the ablative absolute. It is the same, in fact, as
saying postquam Pausanias voluntatem hujus cognovit, «Sco—Alacrior
“ More inspirited.”—In suspicionem. “Under the suspicion.⁷' Lit-
erally, ‘⁴ into the suspicion.’'—In quo sacto. “ In the midst os which
transaction,'' i. a, while he was thus employed. Equivalent to “dum
haee faciebat.''—Accusalas capitis. ‘⁴ Being aceused of a capital of-
fenee.” The term caput is often used by the Roman writers as
equivalent to ‘⁴ person,’⁷ or “human being.⁷’ By an easy transition
it was used to signisy “life,⁷’ and, as in the present instance, of
what involved life—Quam ob causam. At Sparta, the imposition of
a fine carried with it the loss os official rank. Hence Pausanias lost
his command of the fieet.—Remissus non cst. When the negative
requires an emphasis, it is placed in this way before the auxiliarv
verb, and at the end os the clause. ,

Post non multo. “Not long aster.⁷' Observe the peculiar posi-
tion of the words. First eomes a general indication os time, pose,
meaning that it was aster what had been J'ust stated3 and then
comes a limiting phrase, non multo. The common arrangement is
non multo pose. The one given in the text is the same, in fact, as
suying, “Afterward, and, indeed, no long time afterward.''—Ad
exercitum rediit. The fleet is meant, the station of which was nt

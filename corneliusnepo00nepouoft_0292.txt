CHAPTER VIII.

ᾧ 1.

Haec illc intuens. Compare Vit. Alcib„ chapter iv„ ᾧ 1.-ριιεηιαὰ-
‘mudum sedaret. “How he should put a stop to them.'’ Literally,
“should allay them.⁷’—Quorsum evaderent. “W'liere they would
enum-Callicrates. Nepos, in giving this form ofthe name, follows
some authority unknown to us. All other ancient writers call him
Callippus.—H0mo ct callidus, ὅτε. “A man both remarkable sor tact,
and possessed of natural acuteness sor any fraudulent design.” Ob-
serve here the distinction between callidus aud acutus, the former
alluding to the taet and skill acquired by personal experience, the
lultcr to natural disposition. (Bt-cmi, ad loc.)—Sine ulla religione
arsule. ⁶⁴ without any religion and honor.''

ᾧ 2.

Eum. Referring to Dion.—Offensioncm. “The disaffection.’'—-
Quod nullo modo, διο. Observe that quod here refers back to periculo.
—Nz'si alicui suorum negotium daret, &c. “ Unless he should com-
mission some one ofhis friends to pretend himself an enemy to him.⁷’
More literally‚ “unless he should intrust the affair to some one of
his friends, who might pretend,'' &c.—Illz' inimicum. Observe that
inimicus here takes the dative as an adjective, and in the next sen-
tence the genitive as a noun. Compare Zumpt, ς) 410, and consult
note on amicior, Vz‘t. Mile„ chapter iii„ ζ) 6.-ῼιιαιη si invenisset ido-
neum. “That if he should find one fit sor his purpose.’'—-Inimicz
ejus. Compare note on ilii inimicum above—Dissidcmi. “ To one
disaffected toward him.’' With dissidenti supply ab co, the reference
being to Dion.—Aperturi jurent. ‘⁸ WVould be likely to disclose.’'

§3-

Excipit has partes. ‘⁴ Undertook this part.'' The more usual
verb to express the meaning here intended would have been sus-
cepit—Armet. Observe the employment of the present, after a pre-
ceding perfect, excepit, where we would have expected another per-
fect, armavit. This change to the present is osten made in order to
impart more animation to the clause—Socios conquirit. ‘⁴ He seeks
accomplices on all sides.'‘—Conv2nit. ‘⁶ He holds meetings with.''
convenire, with the accusative, is “to meet with one in an inter
view,'’ “to have a meeting or interview with one.’' (Zumpt, ᾧ 387.)

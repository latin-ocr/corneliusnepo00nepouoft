Sibi. Referring to Alcibiades—Seuthem regem ἸἾινᾶεαηι, dre.
0‘ To bring down Seuthes, king os the Thracians, to drive them from
the land.³' Bremi mistakes here the meaning of deducere, which is
not to prevail upon, or persuade, but merely to bring down from the
interior to the coast. Nepos appears to have had in view here Plu-

a naval camp close by the soe.⁷’ This would serve partly as a source

had lest their vessels.—Immmlcslizi. “Throngh the insubordina-
tion,'' z'. c., the disorderly conduct os the crews and soldiers in leav-
ing their vessels, and wandering about the country. The account
given here by Nepos differs from that of Plutarch. According to
the latter, Alcibiades, when he first carne to the camp, told the gen-
erals that he thought their situation by no means safc in a place
where there was neither town nor harhor. That it was very incon-
venient to procure their provisions and stores froin so distant a place
as Sestos, and extremely dangerous to let their scarnen go ashore
and wander about at their pleasure, while a fleet was observing them,
which was under the orders os one man and the strictcst discipline
imaginable. Hc advised them, therefore, to remove their station to
Sestos. On their refusing to listen to his advice, he retired, men-
tioning, at the suine time, to his acquaintnnnvs who escorted him out
ol* tho ιτιιῐη), thail Μ’ th«- generals haid listened to him in a prope!

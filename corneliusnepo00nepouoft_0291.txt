CHAPTER VII.
ᾧ 1.

Nemo enim, illo interfecto, &Q Plutarch’s account is at variance
with this. According to that writer, the death of Heraclides was
at first deeply resented by the citizens; but when Dion bestowed
upon him a magnificent funeral, and pronounced an oration to the
people, their resentment ceased, and they became sensiblo that what
had been done was the only means os restoring peace to the city.—
Licentius eorum bona, διο. “Distributed among the soldiery with
greater freedom the property of those,” ἀρ. Plutarch and Diodorus
are both silent on this head, and the charge is evidently a salse one.
Diodorus says that Dion allowed all the prisoners, who were many
in number, to depart without ransom

Quum quotidiani, dcc. ‘⁸ When his ‹laily expenses were becoming
very great.” Another untrue statement. According to Plutarch,
he lived in the plainest and most frugal manner, as is he had been
passing his days with Plato, amid the simplicity of the Academy.
—Neque, quo manus porrigeret, &c “Nor was there any thing
to which he could stretcli forth his hands, save the possessions
of his friends.” More literally, “nor was there whither he could,
&c.‚ save unto the possessions‚” &c Some editions omit in, by
which possessiones becomes a nominative. This is more in accord-
ance with the English idiom, the other with the Latin—Hujusmbdi
crat. ‘¹ Was marked by the following result.’' More literally, “ wat¹
of the following nature.”—Amitteret. “ He lost the favor of.”

Frangebatur. ‘⁴ He was broken down in spirit‚'' i. e., he was dis-
pirited.—Insu5cus male audiendi. “Unaccustomed to hear himself
ill spoken os.’' Μᾶῐε audire is “to be ill spoken of,” “to hear evil
of one’s self.” On insuetus with the genitive, consult Zumpt, ᾧ 436.
—Fuerat elatus. “He had been exalted.’'—-Offcnsd in eum militum
voluntate. “The seelings os the soldiers being offended at him.'’—-
Et tyrannum non serendum dictitabat. ‘⁴ And frequently said that the
tyraut was not to be endured.‘'

There is great doubt whether Hamilcar went to Spain with any au-
thority from the government. It would appear probable that he
took this important step oshimself, trusting to the popular influence
at Carthage to ratify his measures subsequently ; and it is said that
he secured this confirmation, not only by his brilliant successes, but
by employing the treasures which he obtained in Spain in purchas-
ing adherents at homa—Quo facilius causam bellandi, &Q Nepos
appears to allude here to the project to which Hamilcar henceforth
devoted himself with so much energy‚ and which was so ably sol-
lowed up aster his death by Hasdrubal and Hannibal, that of sorm-
ing in Spain a new empire, which should not only be a source of
strength and wealth to Carthage‚ and compensate for the loss of
Sicily and Sardinia, but should be the point whence he might at a
subsequent period renew hostilities against Rome.

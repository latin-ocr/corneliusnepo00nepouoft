Deinde. ‘⁴ Thcn again.'’— Tempus. “ The occasion-'‘—Lahorzoe
sus. “ He was pains-taking.” Supply crat. The adjective labori-
osus means, literally‚ ‘⁴ full oslabor‚” the terniination -osus denoting
fullness or abnndance. (Zumpt, ε) 252, 9.)--N0n minus in vila quam
in vicia. ‘⁸ No less in his public than in liis private life.’' Observe
here the distinction between vita and victuri, and compare Cicero (De
Leg„ iii„ 14) : “nobilium vila victuque mutato mores mutari civitatum
paco.'⁷ Hence victus denotes the mode of living at home, and des-
ignates not only the sustenance and establishment requisite sor
physica} existence, but also the enjoyment os life in social inter-
course, in table, equipage, &e—Tcmpfirz'bus callidissime inserviens.
‘⁸ Very adroitly adapting himself to the times,'‘ i. e., to every change
⁴ os situation. Plutarch observes of Alcibiades, that he turned him-
sels into all manner of forms with more ease than the chamaeleon
changes its color. At Sparta, he was all sor exercise, frugal in his
diet, and severe in his manners. In Asia, he was for mirth and
pleasure, luxury and ease. In Thrace, riding and drinking were his
savorite amusements; and in the palace of Tissaphernes, the Per-
sian satrap‚ he outvied the Persians themselves in pomp and splen-
dor.

Simul ac se remiserat. “As soon as he had unbent himself.”
Simul ac usually takes the perfect, except when a repeated action
is referred to, and when the verb of the principal clause or sentence
is in the imperfect, as here, where crat is understood aster labari-
osus. (Dadima, ad loc.)—Neque. Equivalent to et nulla.—Sub1}rat.
“Served as a ground.” Observe the force of sub in composition.—
Quare. The more usual term in such a case is cur. Sometimes
quamobrem is employed—Luxuriosus, &Q A climax ending with
intemperans, which denotes a total want of moral restraint.— Ut
omncs admirarentur. “ So that all greatly wondered.’' Observe that
admirarentur here is equivalent to admadum mi1·arc⁷1cur.—Tantam ‹lis-
similitudinem, &e ‘⁴ So much unlikeness (to himself), and so con-
tradictory a nature.” More literally‚ ‘⁵ so opposite a nature.”

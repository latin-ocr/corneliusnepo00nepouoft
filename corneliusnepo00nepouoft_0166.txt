150 NOTES oN 'rna

⁰⁸ one who goes besore,’' ‘⁴ one who takes the lead,” i. e.‚ a leadei
or commander; and it was applied by the Romans, in the earlier
ages of their state, to their generals or military leaders. Thus the
dictator is called praetor maximus. Afterward, however, when the
word, as a Roman title os office, was appropriated to the civil mag-
istrate called the Proelor, it was confined in its military sense to the
generals of a foreign state, especially to the commanders of land
forces. Hence its employment on the present occasion by Nepos.
Compare Con., i., 1 ς Τήοφηίει., ii., 1 ; Arist„ ii., 1, &c.-—Qui praees-
sent. “ To command.” Literally, “to be at the head of.'’ Qui has
here the subjunctive, because equivalent to ut. (Zumpt, ζ) 567.)
Observe, moreover, that although creant, the leading verb, is in the
present, yet praeessent, the following verb, is in a past tense. This
is owing to two causes, first, because the leading verb is merely the
present used sor the past3 and secondly, which is the stronger
reason osthe two, because continuance os action is implied in proecs-
senc. In chapter ii., 4, where we had postulat ut tradat, the present
subjunctive denotes that the action expressed by tradat is to be
quickly performed.

Inter quos. “ Among these.” Elegantly used sor inter Itos. Thc
relative „at the beginning os a clause or sentence is osten to be
rendered into our idiom by a demonstrative.—Corztcntio. “ Dispute,''
i. e., differ-enee of opinion—Momthus. “ By their walls.” Those
of the commanders who dissuadcd from immediately engaging‚
wished to wait sor succors from Sparta, and, in the mean time, to
accustom their troops to the sight os an enemy whose very name
struck terror from a distance—An obviam irent. “Wbether they
should advance to meet.”—Acz'c. ‘⁴ In a pitehed battle.”

ᾧ 5.

Unus Miltiades, &c. “Miltiades alone strove With very great
energy that a camp should be formed as quickly as possible.'’ Ob-
serve the force oswius in strengthening the superlative. (Zumpt,
ᾧ 691.) Observe the employment os the imperfect in nitebamr, to
express the long-continued and unwearied efforts os Miltiades to ac-
complish his object. Observe, also, that primo quoquc tempore is
equivalent to quam celerrime. According to the account given by
Herodotus, the opinions of the ten generals were equally divided,
and the casting vote, in favor os fighting, was given by the pole-
march Callimachus—Et civibus animum accessurum. “That both
courage would be added to their countrymen.'’ Litcrally, “would
approacl unto,’' τ’. c., would add itsels unte.

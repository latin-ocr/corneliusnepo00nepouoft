charge successsully.⁷’ Provincia is here used in its general sense
of a charge, or command, with which one is intrusted. The pro·
vincia, in the present case, was the conquest of Syracuse—Non pa-
rere noluit. “ He would not disobey.” Literally, “he was not un-
willing to obey.” A much stronger form of expression than a mere
affirmative clause would have been-Et in trit-cmm, &c “But
went on board a trireme,” &a With triremem supply navem, liter-
ally, “a ship with three banks of oars.’' Compare Vit. Themist„
chapter ii.‚ ᾧ 8, where the full form is given. The account here
given by Nepos is not strictly accurate. The Athenians sent the
Salaminia, or state-galley, after Alcibiades, but hc did not return in
this, being permitted, together with the other persons involved in
the like charges, to accompany the Salaminia in his own galley.

Thurios. “To Thurii.’' This was a city of Lucania, in Italy,
founded by an Athenian colony, near the site of Sybaris—In Italiam.
The Latin language is much more precise in such cases as the pres-
ent than the English, where we merely employ the simple “in‚” z'. e.‚
“in Italy.”-ch11tans. “ Reflecting.'’ The resolution taken by
Alcibiades in the present case was not, as Nepos states, the result
of deep reflection‚ but was formed almost as soon as he received
the summons. He knew his countrymen too well to be long in
doubt what course to pursue—Dc immoderata civium, &a “On
the ungovernable license of his countrymen.” The reference is to
the wayward feelings and license of the mou—Clam sc a custodibus
subduxit. He went on shore at Thurii, along with his companionS,
and concealed himself until the Salaminia sailed away. The lan
guage of Nepos, therefore, is incorrect here, since there were, in
fact, no custodes from whom to withdraw—Elidem. ‘⁶ To Elis.'’
He crossed from Thuriijn a merchant vessel, along with his follow·
exiles, to the Elean port of Cyllene, and there he received an invi-
tation from the Spartan government to proceed to Sparta. He did
not go from Elis to Thebes.

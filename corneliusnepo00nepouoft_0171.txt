tended for walking and as a place of public resort. The one here
referred to was called Ποικΐλη (scil. Στοά), because adorned with
paintings on subjects taken from Athenian history, among which
was the one representing the battle os Marathon.

Quum pugna depingeretur ,Μαναίὴόηἱω “ ΣΥῘΙΘΠ the battle of Mar-
athon was painted thereon.⁷' Observe the soree of the preposition
in depingeretur, the reference being to a sresco painting on the wall
of the portico. The name of the principal artist, in executing the
pieee, was Panaenus, and he was assisted by Micon. A full descrip-
tion of the painting, which represented three successive stages of
the battle, is given by Pausanias (i., loy—Prima. “Foremost,⁷'
i. e., in advanee os the rest—Isque hortaretur, &c. “And that he
should be represented as exhorting the soldiers and giving the sig-
nal sor battle.’' The ordinary meaning os committere proelium is “to
join or begin battle.” The painting referred to in the text was re
markable on another account, as being one os the earliest pictures
in which an artist rejected the ancient plan (which we still see on
vases, ἀο.) os affixing to his figures the names os the persons they
were intended to represent, and yet succeeded in indicating who
they were by some other method, such as position, the peeuliar
sashion os their armor, &e This explanation appears to be strik-
ingly confirmed by a passage os AEschines (c. Clas„ p. 437), who tells
us that Miltiades requested the people that his name might be in-
scribed on this picture, but they refused his request‚ and only granted
him the privilege mentioned in our text.

the eontrast between early and later periods of Athenian history.—
Est nactus . . . ἰ corruptus est. The est is repeated here, as Bremi
remarks, on account of the difference of voice in the two verbs,
the former being active, the latter passive in signification.-Majus
imperium. The allusion is to their dominion of the sea, unto which
they attained in a subsequent period of their history, but which they

‘the large sums of money spent on public amusements sor the grati—

spirit.—Trecencas statuas, ἄιε. “ Decrced thrcc hundred statues to

statesman, a philosopher, and a poet. His surname Phalc'rc—us was
given to him srorn his birth-place, the Attio borough of Phalerum.

Receperat. “ Had recove1·ed.'’ Recipere appears to be the proper
term to indicate a regaining by voluntary surrender‚ or by treaty,
without a battle, and hence many passages of the ancient writers,
in which recipere is explained by the simple capere, may be more ac-
curately elucidated. (Bromi, acl loc.)—Hcllcsp0ntum. The renewal
os the Athenian supremacy throughout the Hellespont and Propon-
tis secured the control of the Euxine, and a lucrative revenue from
tolls levied on ships passing through the straits.—Neqzie minus mul·
tas, διο. “Nor had they attached sewer to their alliance by their
politic course of conduct.’⁷-Fueranc usi. “ They had exercised.''

In Piraeeum. “ To the Piraeeus.’' ThiS, as already remarked‚ was

to behold Alcibiades. It is more forcible than videre would have
been—Proinde ac si solus advenisset. “Just as if he had come
alone.⁷’ Plutarch says that the people did not so much as look upon
the other generals, but, crowding up to AlcibiadeS, hailed him with
shouts of joy, conducted him on the way, and crowned him with
garlands. Compare what follows in Nepos, <) 3.

Sic enim populo erat persuasum. ‘⁴ For the people were persuaded
ofthisss’ Observe that sic is here inserted to add strength to the
expression. Compare, sor a similar employment of ita, Vic. Themist„
chapter ix.‚ ἰ) 1.-Ει adversas superiores. “ That both their former
mis'sortunes.” Supply res—Ejus opera. ‘¹ Through his moans.'’—
Amissum. “The loss.'’ Amissus is a verbal noun osthe fourth de-
clension‚ derived srom amicto, and the present is the only instance
os its employment by a Latin writer. Substantivcs os this kind are
very rare in the Golden Age os Latinity‚ their places being supplied

Extrcmis temporibus. “ Toward the close ofhis life.⁷’—Odium, διο.
“Odium with,⁷’ &cz—Primo. This is written as ispostea or deinde
quod were to follow, After enlarging, however, on this first cause of
odium, Nepos states the second quite independently in ᾧ 4.-Βεπιᾶᾱε.
Demades was an Athenian orator, who belonged to the Macedonian
party, and was a bitter enemy of Demosthenes. He was put to
death by Antipater ΒΟ. 318.—De urbe tradenda Antipatro. This
was after the victory gained over the Greeks at Cranon, in Thes-
saly, by the Macedonian forces, which placed Athens at the mercy
of Antipater.—Ejusque consilio, &o Not so. The surrender of
Demosthenes and Hyperides was one of the conditions imposed by
Antipater.—Dcmoschciics cum celcris . . . . erant expulsi. When the
subject ofa verb is a singular noun, joined to another noun by the
preposition cum, the predicate, strictly speaking, should be in the
singular ; but as the idea os plurality is conveyed in such a construc-
tion, the plural is frequently used, especially when a sentence in-
tervencs, as here, between the main subject and the predicate.
Hence Demosthenes cum ceteris is here equivalent in fact to Demos
thenas ει ceteri. Compare Zumpt, t> 375.-A1micz'tiaefidem non praestz't
erat. “Had not discharged the duty of faithful friendsliip.’' Lit-
erally, ‘⁸ the fidelity of friendship.'’

Auchis. ‘⁴ Having been elevated.”-Eum, quem tenebat, διο.
“ Hc had attained to the eminence which he at present possessed.’'
Literally, “ he had mounted that step,⁷’ &e-Quum adversus Chari-
tem, &c- “When he (Demosthenes) supplied him with aid against
Chares‚'’ i. e., with the means of attacking Chares, and depriving
him of his command. The reference appears to be to B.C. 341,
when Phocion obtained the command ofthe troops which were dis-
patched to Euboea on the motion os Demosthenes.

Uno crimine. “ On one cliarge.’‘-Cassandri praesectum. “The
general of Cassander.'' He was holding the Munychia at this time
with a garrison⁴ Munychia was a hill in the peninsula of Piraeeus,
strongly fortified‚ and forming the citadel of the ports of Athens.—
I’iraeeo. Consult notes on Theium, vi, l.—Dercyllo. Dercyllus

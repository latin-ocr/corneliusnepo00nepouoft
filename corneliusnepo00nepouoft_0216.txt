ᾴ 506.—Propinquos tuos. “That they were thy near 1·elations.'‘
Supply essa-Seque tecum, &c. The order is, cupitque se conjungi
tecum, &a-Dcs ei filiam tuam nuptum. ‘⁶ Give him thy daughter in
marriage.” Observe the employment of the subjunctive dcx as a

nubo, and the literal translation here would be ‘⁴ to veil (herself),''

thou send a trusty person unto him.’' Literally, “ cause that thou
send.'’ Supply ut before mittas, which is here elegantly omitted;
and on this periphrasis sor the imperative, consult Zumpt, <> 586.-
Face. The usual form issac. Nepos, however, uses the fuller and
earlier form here, in order to avoid the harshness of saying sac, cnm
quo.—(Daclznc, ad loc.)—Colloqualur. ‘⁴ He may eonser.’'

Tam sibi necessariorum. ‘¹ So nearly allied to hims' Necessaria·
in Latin are, like ἀναγκαῖοι in Greek, persons connected with one
hy necessary or natural ties, i. c., kinssolk, blood-relations.-Artaba-

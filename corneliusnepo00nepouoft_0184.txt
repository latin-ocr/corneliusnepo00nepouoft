a pious fraud got up by Themistocles.

Τᾶίι consilio. “ So excellent a plan as this.⁷’ Literally‚ ‘¹ such a
plan.” Tali is much more emphatic here than hoc would have been,
and implies commendation.—Addunc ad εαρῑνίῡνεε, &c. “They add
to their former ones as many ships again, with three banks osoars.”
This is very loosely worded. The Athenians had no time to con-
struet or equip many ships. Herodotus merely says that they re-
solved to build additional ones, without specisying any number.—
Salamina. Accusative os Salamis, and denoting motion whither.
Salamis was an island in the Saronic Guls, separated srom Attica by
a narrow stram—Troezena. Accusative os Troezcn. ,Troezen or
Troezene was a city in Argolis, near the eastern coast„ and below
Epidaurus—Arcem. The Acropolis or citadcl of Athens is meant,
containing the Temple os Minerva and other sacred edifices—Sacer-
dacz'bus paucisque, &c. Herodotus gives a different account from
this. According to him, the only individuals who remained in the
Acropolis were the treasurers of the Temple of Minerva, and some
indigent persons, who did not cross over to Salamis partly on ac-
count of their poverty‚ and partly from an erroneous view os the
meaning os the oracle. Hence they sortified the Acropolis with a
wooden palisade, and in this condition awaited the barbarians.—
Ad sacra procuranda. ‘⁸ For the persormance os certain sacred rites.”
More literally‚ “to take care os sacred rites.” The common text
has ac sacra procuranda, sor which we have given the conjectural
reading ad sacra procuranda. The objection to ac is, that arcem and
sacra are so sar apart as to make it very unlikely that they are in-
tended to be connected by “and” Besides, as Nepos afterward
says that the city was taken ‘⁶ nullis dcscrzdcntz'bus,” he would seem
to wish to convey the idea here that the object os the movement
itselswas not a desence os the citadel‚ but merely a continuation of
sacred rites. It is true, nullis defendentibus is historically incorrect.
since the citadel wrs obstinately defended ; still, however, this need
not surprise us in such a writer as Nepos—Relinquunt. ‘⁸ They
desert.’'

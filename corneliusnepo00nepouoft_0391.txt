XXIII. HANNIBAL.

CHAPTER I.
ᾧ 1.

Hannibal. This name, according to Gesenius, signifies “the grace
or favor os Baal ;'’ the final syllable bal, os such common occurrence
in Punic names, always having reference to this tutelary deity os
the Phoenicians.—Si verum est . . . . ut. “ Isit be true . . . . that.”
The construction with ut iu the present passage, instead ofthe ac-
cusative with the infinitive, is very remarkable. It is equivalent to
sire vera factum est, ut‚· the ut being used afterfacio, and its passive
form, to denote “ happening'⁷ as a “ result'’ or ‘⁶ effect.'' Compare
Zumpt, ὁ 623, where this passage is noted—Praestitissc. “Sur-
passed.'’—Anteccdat. “Excel.” The subjunctive, on account of
the accusative with the infinitive.

ᾧ 2, 3.

Quotiescumque. The strict correlative would be toties, but its
place is supplied by the general term semper.—Cum eo. Namely‚
with the Roman people through their commanders and armies.—
Quod nisi domi, &c “And had he not, therefore, been enseebled
through the envy of his countrymen at home.” Hannibal was al-
ways seebly and grudgingly supported by the government at home.
Had it been otherwise, the result of the contest would very probably
have been different—Deficit. ‘⁶ Prevailed against,'’ i. e., frustrated.
—Vclut hoeredz'tate relictum. “As if left (to him) by inheritance,''
i. e.‚ just as isit had been bequeathed to him as a legacy by his
father's will.—Qui quidem. “ For he, indeed.’'—Et alienarum opum
indigeres. “ And stood in need of the resources of others,'’ i. e., of
relies from them.

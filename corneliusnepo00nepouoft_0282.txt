Plato visited Sicily three times. The first time, which is the one
here alluded te, he came to that island, not on the invitation of Dion,
but either, according to the statement of all the writers who make
mention of this tour, in order to sec the volcano of AEtna, or else,
as one os the Platonic epistles states, to study the character os the
inhabitants, their instituthms, and laws. He first became acquainted
with Dion at the court of Dionysius. Plato's second visit to Sicily
was made many years subsequently, and probably soon after the
death of the elder Dionysius. It was on this occasion that Dion in-
vited him to corne from Athens, where he was settled as an instruet-
or, in order that he might win the younger Dionysius to philosophy.
The third visit was paid a few years later (about Bc. 361), on the
invitation of Dionysius himself, in order to settle the disputes which
had broken out shortly aster Plato‘s departure between him and Dion.

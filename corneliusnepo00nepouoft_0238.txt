Ephorus, of the mode in which Lysander meant to bring about the
revolution which he meditated at Sparta, is chiefly remarkable as
showing the degree of eredulity which he attributed to his country-
men. There was, it seems, somewhere on the coast of the Euxine,
a young impostor named Silenus, who gave himself out as the son
of Apollo. Lysander had prevailed upon this youth to lend himself
to his designs, and hoped first to gain the sanction os the Delphie
oracle sor the impostor's pretensions, and then to use his authority
to confirm a forgcd prophecy which was to be brought to light at
Sparta, to the effect that the state would be more prosperous if the
kings were elected from the worthiest citizens. Plutarch conceives
that Lysander did not fall upon the thought of his machinery in aid
of his revolutionary plans until they had been so sar maturcd thatr
he had procui-ed a speech to be written for him by Cleon of Halicar-
nassus, with which he intended to recommend the measure. He
was then struck with the difficulty of the cnterprise, and bethought
himself os playing upon the superstition and credulity os the Spar-
tans. All was ready sor the execution of his projeet, when one of
his associates became srightened and withdrew; and his own un-
timely death put an end to it. Nor was it discovered until the
speech was found in his house, which, however, Agesilaus was in-
duced to suppress by the advice os the Ephor Lacratrdas. (Thirt-

¹‘ Posted.’' TbiS, like consisterent, is well selected. It denotes the
posting of each one in his proper place.

Hoc exercitu. “With this body of men so trained.” · Observe the
force os exercitus—Moram Lacedaemoniorum intercepit. ‘⁴ He cut off
a mora of the Lacedaemonians.” The mora or regiment 'of the Spar-
tans consisted, in Xenophon's time, of six hundred foot and one
hundred horse. It was a custom, and one held very sacred, that the
Amyclaeans should always be at home at the Hyacinthian festival.
⁷ On the present occasion, some os the men of Amyclae were in gar-
rison at Lechaeum, one of the harbors of Corinth, and, in order that
they might reach home in safety‚ they were escorted past Corinth,
where Iphicrates was with his troopS, by a mora. The polemarch‚
directing the horse to go a little sarther with the Amyclaeans‚ then
turned back; but, being intercepted on his return by Iphicrates and
Callias, most ofhis infantry were cut to pieces, while the horse es-
caped principally to Lechaeum—Quod maxime tota, &e This ex-
ploit had more importance assigned to it than we should be inclined
at first to imagine possible, as is clear from the grief which it caused
in the camp of Agesilaus, from the caution with which he marched
home through the Peloponnesus, and from the suspension of the
Theban negotiations sor terms with Sparta.

Iterum eodem bello, &c. Nothing whatever is known of this second
defeat of the Lacedaemonians, The statement, therefore, must be
an erroneous one, unless, perhaps, it refers to the defeat of Anaxib-
ius near Abydos, when Iphicrates was sent to the Hellespont‚ as
already mentioned in the notes on ᾧ l of this chapter.

Artaxerxes. The second of the name, king of Persia, and sur
lamed Mnemon, from his good memory.—AEgypti0 regi. The king
af Egypt here meant was Acoris, who aided Evagoras, king of Cy-
pruS, against Artaxerxes. He died about B.C. 374, before the Per-
sians entered Egypt, which was in the following year. He was suc-
ceeded by &manabis—Voluit. The perfect indicative is rather
surprising here. We would naturally expect the imperfect subjunc-
tive. Compare Zumpt, ᾤ 58ος Madvig, ὁ 358.—Quem proeficeret.
For ut cum praeficerct.--Exercitui conductitio. “Over his mercenary
{orces—Cujus numeru-3, &c. ‘⁶ Whose number consisted of twelve
thousand.’' The more correct account makes the number twenty
thousand, and to have been sent by the Athenians. Observe that
millium strictly (lepends on numerus to be supplied—Fabiani. ‘⁴ Fa-
bianS,'’ i. e.‚ the men os Fabius. Probably from Q. Fabius Maximus

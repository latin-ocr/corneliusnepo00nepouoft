in the vicinity os tlie Caspian, but, being driven from these by the
Massagetae, they emigrated to the countries around the River Ta
nais, or Don, and to the north of the Euxine. They were a noma-
dic or pastoral people. Niebuhr makes them to have been a Mongo-
liau race.

In Histro flumine. “On the River Hister,” i. ε., over the Low-
er Danube. The more common sorm of the name is Ister, with-
out the aspirate. (Wagner, ad Virg„ Gcorg., ii., 497.) The eastern
part of the Danube, from the Junction os the Savus, or Saave, to the
mouth os the stream, was called the Hister, forming what is some-
times styled the Lower Danube, the classieal name sor the Upper
Danube being the Danubius. The bridge was made just above
the head of the delta formed on the mouth of the river, the fieet
having sailed up the stream sor that purpose. On passing the His-
ter, the army would come at once into Scythia—Qua. “W'here.'’
Used adverbially. The sull form of expression would be qua parte

AEolis was also a Greek seulement along the coast of Asia Minor,
north of Ionia. Nepos makes mention here merely os the Ionian
and AEolian tyrants. But Darius took with him, besides these, the
tyrants or rulers of the Greek cities of the Europcan coast from the
Hellespont to the Bosporus. It was in the number of the latter that
Miltiades was found—Ipsarum urbium. “Os the cities os these
same regions.'' Ipsarum refers to Ionia and AEolis, as Hohler cor-
rectly remarks. Some translate, “ ostheir own cities.’' This, how-
ever, would require rather ipsorum.

Clausus. “Though inclosed.”-Vcrba dedit. “He deceived.”
Followed by the dative—Obducta nocte. “ Night having corne on.’¹
Literally, ‘⁴ night having been drawn over (the sky)‚'‘ i. e., under the
covering ofnight.—Generis. Supply pecorum. The reference is to
cattle thus prepared—Dispalatam. “ Scattered here and there.’‘—
Ut nemo extra vallum, διο. It would have been more correct to say
that the Romans, in alarm, quitted their favorable position, by which
they had cut off Hannibal’s retreat, and that the latter immediately

occupied it.

Μ. Minucium Rufum. Minucius, who had been before this ‘⁶ mas-
ter os the horse’' under the dictator Fabius, was by a special law
made equal in power with the latter, and had the command os one
hals of the army given to him. The excessive cantion os Fabius
had rendered him unpopular, and it was thought that, is proper efforts
were made, it would be an easy matter to d‘rive Hannibal from Italy.
Minucius thereupon, having rashly suffered himselfto be drawn into
an engagement, was only saved from utter destruction by Fabius
coming to his aid. As a return sor this, he resigned his command
to Fabius, and again obeyed him as his general—Tiberium Sempro-
nium Gracchum. Not to be consounded with the father of the two
Gracchi. He fell in a conflict with Mago, at a place called campi
Veteres, in Lucania, and his body was sent to Hannibal, who gave it
an honorable burial.—It‹:rum consulem. “While a second time con-
sul.” This is incorrect ; it was aster his second consulship, so that
Nepos ought to have said his consulem, “aster having been twice
consul.’'—In Lucanis. ‘⁶ Among the Lucani.’' These were the in-
habitants of Lucania, a district os Italy to the south of Campania
and Samnium. Observe that in Lucanis belongs to sustulit, not to
absens, which last indicates that the battle was fought by one os
Hannibal’s generals during his absence.

M. Claudium Marcellum. This is the celebrated conqueror osSyr-
acuse. He was slain, not aster, but during his fifth cdnsulsbip, so
that Nepos ought to have said quintum consulem—Venusiam. Ve-
nusia was a town os Apulia, near Mount Vultur, and memorable at
a later day as the birth-place os the poet Horace.

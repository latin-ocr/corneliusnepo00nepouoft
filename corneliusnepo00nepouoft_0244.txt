ployed because the reference is to an action as yet undetermined‚
and to take place in the future. (Zumpt, <) 576.)—0mnes Hermae.
“All the Hermae.” These were square blocks os stone surmounted
by a head os Hermes or Mercury, and which were placed before the
doors ostemples and houses in Athens ; a relic os more simple times,
in which the presence os the god was expected to guard the en-
trance from violence. Nepos here makes them to have been all but
one thrown down ; according to Thucydides, however (vi.‚ 27), the
greater part had their visages mutilated (οἱ πλεῖστοι περιεκόπησαν τὰ
πρόςωπα).-Ιη oppido Athenis. It has been supposed by some that
Athenis here is a mere gloss, since Nepos osten uses oppidum alone
to indicate the city of Athens. The name os the place, however, is
osten appended to urbs and oppidum, as, for example, urbs Roma,
where Roma might have been omitted. As regards the ablative
Athenis here, in apposition with oppido, compare Vit. Cim„ chap. iii.,
z} 4, “in oppido Cicro.”—Andoe{dis. Andocides the orator is meant.
He was involved in the charge brought against Alcibiades sor having
mutilated the Hermae, because the Hermes standing close to his
house, in the phyle AEgeis, was among the very few which had not
been injured.—-Amlocidis. WVe have given the genitive here with
Bremi and others. The common reading is Andocides. Benecke
includes all from ille to vocitatus cst in brackets.—V5cz'tatus estv
“Was often called.” Observe the soree of the frequentative.

sudden violence should take its rise,'' &c Literally‚ “should stand
forth.’' The mutilation of the Hermae was not only generally be-
lieved to bode ill to the expedition to Sicily, but even, as Nepos
states, was thought to indicate a design to overthrow the democracy.

“He had made a still larger number his friends by aiding them in
their law concerns.‘' Literally‚ “ by sorensic aid,” i. e., in the agora,
where the law courts were commonly held.

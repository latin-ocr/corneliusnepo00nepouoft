companyl” The reference in primum locum adium is to the part
of th‘e Roman house called atrium. This was originally the only
sitting room, where the mistress sat with her maid-servants, en-
’ gaged in spinning and other domestic employments. Artemam, in
the houses of the wealthy, it was distinct from the private apart-

space. In the plural it means “ a house,‘' as consisting of many

the biography of Hannibal. The life of Cato will then form part of
the second book of the main work, which we may suppose contained

the Roman lives.

Egina, and off the southwestern coast os Attica.-—Praetor. ‘⁴ Com
mander.” Compare Mile„ i., 4, 4.—-—Fcr0cz'orem. “More during. ’
Used here in a sense different from its ordinary one, not as indi-
eating ferocity, but rather a daring and haughty spirit.

§2

Quae ez metallis redibat. “Which carne in from the mines.’³ The
mines here meant were the silvei· ones at Laurium, near the Sunian
promontory, or lower extremity of Attica. In the Athenian revenue,
the income arising from the mines was a regular receipt—Largi-
tione magistratuum quotannis interiret. ‘⁶ Carne to naught yearly
through the lavish distribution os it by the magistrates.’' Observe
the force of interiret. Literally, “perished‚” i. e., was lost to the
state. The Athenians were accustomed to distribute among them-
· selves every year the money accruing from the mines at Laurium.
Nepos here erroneously makes this the act ofthose in office, whereas
it was one emanating direetly from the people themselves, and only
to be discontinued by a deeree of the people-Pcrsuasit . . . ut.
This is the regular construction of persuadeo. When it means “to
convince‚'’ it takes the accusative and infinitive. (Zumpt, §6150—
Centum navium. This same number is given by Plutarch. Herod-
otus, on the other hand, says that two hundred were built. To ree-
oncile these authorities, Thirlwall supposes that the Athenians had
already one hundred vessels, and that now, by the addition os an-
other hundred, the original number was doubled. Boeekh, however,
relying in part on the authority of Polyaenus, conjectures that the
sum of money expended on the new triremes was the saving of
several years· income from the mines, and that, by a repetition of
the practice, a second one hundred were subsequently built. (Pub-
lic Econ. of Athens, vol. ii.‚ p. 464.)

§a

Qud celeriter effecta. “Which (ficet) having been quickly con-
structed.'⁷ Supply classa—Corcyraeos. According to the remark
made under ᾧ 1, we must refer this to the people of Aigina, not to
the Corcyreans.-Fregit. ‘⁴ He humbled,'’ i. e., he broke down their
spirit by defeat—Maritimos praedones consectando. “By vigorously
pursuing the sea-robbers,” ι’. ε., the pirates. Proedo being a general
term, and denoting any kind os robber‚ the cpithet maritimus is
added in order to render the meaning more definite. Observe,
moreover, the soree os the frequentative in consectanda—In quot
“In doing which.” Literally, “ in which.” There is no ellipsis

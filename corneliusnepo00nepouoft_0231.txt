Sed in paca. The more common form os expression would have
been sed ctiam in pace, or vcmm ctiam in pace.—Dcsideraveru›nt.
“Missed.‘’—Quum compluribus, &c. The order of construction is,
ut, quum, &c.—-Praedia. “ Landed estates.” Pnedium, according to
Varro, signified originally any property which was made a security
to the state by a proes or surety sor another—In eis. The more
usual form would have been the dative cis. W'e very seldom find
such a phraseology as custodem imponere in loco. WVhen we wish to
express the placing osa keeper over a person, we must always use
the dative. (Bremi‚ ad loc.)—Quo minus ejus rebus, διο. “ From
enjoying his things, which each might wish (to enjoy),⁷¹ i. e.‚ as each
one might wish. After vellet supply frui.

any thing else—Differcndo. ‘⁶ By putting him off.”—Quum aliquem
offensum, &e “When he saw any one whom he had chanced to
meet unexpectedly.'’ Offendere aliquem is “to meet one unexpect-
edly.” Fortuna is here put sor force. Sometimes both forms are
found together, sorte fortuna. Some commentators connect offensum
and fortuna together in construction, and make the phrase equiva-
lent to ¹⁴ cuifortiina essct iniqua ;'’ but this can not be supported by
any similar examples. Compare Bremi‚ ad loc.- Vidbrct. The sub-
junctive, because the reference is not to one particular aet, but to
many at different and uncertain times.

Sic. “So abundantly.'’—Invocatos. “ Not invited.'’ Invocatos

troops to contribute to the desence of Africa, and even of Carthage
itsels.-Alterum cum Hasdrubale, &c Part of this army was com-
posed of Asricans.--Tertium. Hannibal quitted his winter quarters
at New Carthage in the spring os ΒΟ. 218, and crossed the Iberus
with an army osnincty thousand soot and twelve thousand horse.—
Saltum Pyrenaeum. “ The Pyrenaean sorest‚’' i. e., the woody range
os the Pyrenees. The tribes between the Iberus and the Pyrenees
offered at first a vigorous resistance ; and though they were quickly
subducti, Hannibal thought it necessary to leave behind him a force
os eleven thousand men, under Hann0‚ to maintain this newly-ac
quired province. His forces were sarther thinned during the pas-
sage os the Pyrenees by desertion, which obliged him to send home
a large body os his Spanish troops. With a greatly diminished army,
but one on which he could securely rely, he now continued his
march from the soot os the Pyrenees to the Rhone without meeting
with any opposition, the Gallic tribes through which he passed being
favorably disposed to him, or having been previously gained over by
his emissaries.

Hac copias traduxit. A'ccording to the most probable view of the
subject, Hannibal crossed the Graian Alps, or the Little Se. Bernard.
It can not be dcnied, however, that there are difficulties attending
this line of march, especially in regard to the descent into Italy.
According to Polybius, he descended first among the Insubres.
Others, less correctly, make him to have come first into the-terri-
tory os the Taurini. When he entered Italy, he had with him no
more than twenty thousand soot and six thousand horse

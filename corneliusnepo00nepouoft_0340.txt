324 NOTES ON 'rna

The sentence began as if Epaminondas were the subject, but Ne·
pos here changes the construction, and makes the subject to be the
Lacedaemonians. The account which he gives of the battle is quite
imperfect. Epaminondas sell in the moment of victory, when charg-
ing with the pointed phalanx, which Xenophon compares in figure
to the bow of a galley.--In unum. “Upon him alone.’'—Pugnan-
tem. fl While fighting.”-—-Sparo eminus percussum. “After having
been struck by a dart (hurled) from a distance.” The variations of
tradition, as to the hand by which he fell, prove the importance
which his contemporaries attached to the event. Among the claim-
ants were a Mantineam a Spartan, and a Locrian osAmphissa. The
Spartan's descendants became a privileged family. The Locrian re-
ceived heroic honors from the Phocians. But the Athenians, and
the Thebans themselves, assigned the deed to Xenophon’s son
Gryllus, who was slain in the action. Yet as Gryllus served in
the Athenian cavalry, it is difficult to understand how he could have
encountered Epaminondas, who was at the head of the Theban in-
fantry.

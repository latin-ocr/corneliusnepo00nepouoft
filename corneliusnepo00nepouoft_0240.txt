§3.

Postquam dixerat. observe the employment os postquam with tho
plupersect‚ the perfect being much more common in such cases, and
compare Zumpt, §x 507, h.—Apud maximum magistratum. “Before
the chief magistracy‚’' i. e., the ephori. The more usual form here
would be the plural. The singular, however, stands sor the whole
body of ephori combined—Quae voluerat. The pluperfect here marks
the wish as having existed before the time of his address. (Arnold,
ad loc.)—Testimc'1niiloco. ‘⁸ By way ostestimonial.'' More literally,
“ in the place of ριτοοῑ,η 2'. e„ as a proof os the truth os what he had
alleged—Summbto. “Hav'rng been caused to withdraW.’'-Cog-
nossent. ‘⁴ Had attentively read.'‘ This meaning of cognosco arises
from its ordinary one, “to know well or thorougbly.'’—Impn·1den3
ipse, ἀρ. “ Became himself unawares his own accuser.” Verbal
nouns in or, ix, io, and us, usually take the genitive of the personal
pronoun; so that here accusator sui would be more usual Latinity
than suus accusator. One os the MSS„ moreoyer‚ actually has επεὶ
in the present passage, which some editors adopt. lVe have sol·
lowed, however, the ordinary reading, and in support os it, besides
the concurrent testimony os the MSS„ may refer to Cicero, Dc Off,
i.‚ 39, where a similar construction occurs ε “ Habenda ratio non sua
solum, sed eciam aliorum-'³ (Brenni, ad loc.)

Quo itinere. “ On the way whither.”-—Fucuras insidias. “ That
the ambuscade would be laid sor him.‘’—Simz'llimum sui. “One
very like himsels.” In Cicero and most os the older writers, similis
has a genitive when it refers to living beings‚ and a genitive and
dative indifferently when it concerns inanimate objeets.. Livy and
the poets os the Augustan age were the first who employed the da-
tive as well as the genitive in the former case—Eo Ioco ire, dcc.
“Ordered him to goin that part of the line of march in which he
himself had been 'accustomed (to go).’' After Ioco supply agminis,
and after ire the pronoun cum—Ornata vestituque militari. “ With
the equipments and in the attire os a common soldier.‘’-—-Corporis
custodes. ‘1 His body—guards.'’

Agmen.' Observe that agmen denotes a body ossoldiers in march-
ing order, acics one in battle army—Ordine. “By the position‚''
i. e.‚ the place in the line of march—Suppositus erat. ‘⁴ Had been
substituted.”—Proedixerat. “Had previously given instructions.''
—Itcr faciebat. ‘⁸ He was marching.''—Parati essent facere. Supply
id, and after ipsum the verb facere. On the construction os paro
with the infinitive, consult Zumpt, &5 614.—Conjccic. The preposi-
tion here in composition gives the verb the additional idea os a vig-
orous discharge of missiles.

CHAPTER X.

§1,2.

Extremo tempore. “At last.”—Sz· ci rea: permitteret. We would
here naturally expect sibi, but the writer is supposed to speak in
his own person, and hence ci is employed. (Zumpt, 0550.)-Dc-
disset. ‘⁴ Should have pledged.”

Hanc uc accepit, dcc. “WVhen he received this, sent from the
king.” With hanc supply dextram. By sending his right hand is
meant that accredited persons were empowered to act as the king's
representatives, namely, to give the right hand as a pledge os saith
in his name and in his place—Absens. “ Though absent.’'- Vexat.
“ Harasses.'’ Observe the asyndeton in this whole sentence, and
the animated air which it gives to the narrative.

Aster the death os Phocion, he was placed by Cassander at the head

of affairs in Athens, and governed that city sor the space os ten Ι

years with so much moderation and wisdom, that the Athenians,
from a feeling os gratitude, erected to him the statues mentioned in
the text. The actual number os these was three hundred and fisty
or three hundred and sixty. Nepos, however, as Bremi remarks,
merely gives a round number in speaking orthem, minute accuracy
not being required in such a case as the present.

CHAPTER Vn.
φ 1.

Insulas. The Cyclades are meant, a cluster os islands in the
AEgean Sea, encircling Delos. Herodotus gives a somewhat differ-
ent account from Nepos. He insorrns us that, aster the battle, Mil-
tiades endeavored to urge the Athenians to measures os retaliation‚
and induced them to intrust to him an armament of seventy ships,
without knowing toward what object he would direct the expedition,
out satisfied with his assurance that it would enrich them. He se-
cretly designed, it seems, to attack the island of Paros, where he
Jiad a private enemy, who had once inJured his credit with the Per-
sians—Quoe barbaros adjuverant. By “ barbarians‘' are here meant
the Persians. On the usual meaning os the term in the Greek
writers, consult notes on chapter ii.‚ 1. The indicative adjuverant
is employed here, because Nepos states the matter himself as an
historical fact—Bello persequeretur. “ He might punish in war.”

Quo imperio. “In which command.''—Ad officinm. “To their
duty.’' In the present case, their duty was obedience to the Athe-
nian rule; the duty of inferiors to &periers—Coegit. This verb
must be taken here, as Bremi remarks, in a somewhat subdued
sense, and not as referring to any actual force or violent means;
so that it stands opposed, as it were, to vi expugnavit.

by negotiation the island Paros, os the number os those, rendered
haughty by its resources,'⁷ &c The words from er his to elatam in-
clusive are here placed before quum, to bring them in a more mark-

give Paron, the Greek form os the accusative. Paros, now Paro,

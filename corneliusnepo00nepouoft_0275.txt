Defecerat a rege Tissaphernes. The correction of this error has
been already given in the notes on the previous chapter, ᾧ 2.—Quam
ceteris, dcc. We have here a glimpse of the true account, namely,
the charges of disaffection brought by others against Tissaphernes.
—Multis enim magnisque, &c. “For he possessed great influence
with the king, by reason of his many and great services,'’ &c. Tis-
saphernes had been particularly serviceable to the king in the affair
of Cyrus the Younger‚ when the latter sought to dethrone his brother
Artaxerxes—Ad credendam. “To believe it‚'’ i. 6., the defection
of Tissaphernes—Ejus se opera, &o Observe that se is the accu-
sative of the subject, Cyrum of the object.

Hujus accusandi gratia, &e The confused and contradictory
statements of the later writers make it very difficult for us to ar-
rive at any thing certain respecting this visit of Conon’s to the Per-
sian court. It would appear, however, to have preceded the death
of Tissaphernes. One of Conon's main objects seems to have been
to counteract the policy os Tissaphernes, and to induce Artaxerxes
to withdraw his confidence from him, and transfer it to Pharnaba—
zus, with whom he seems to have connected himself as soon as that
satrap's friendly relations to Sparta had ceased. According to Jus-
tin (vi.‚ 1), Pharnabazus went up to the king and accused Tissapher-
nes. (Compare Diod. Sic„ xiv.‚ 39.)—Clziliarclzum. “The visir.”
The Greek term χιλίαρχος was the one employed by thc Macedoni-
ans and others to designate the Persian vistr. It properly means
“a oommander of a thousand men,” and is rendered by some, in the
present instance, ‘⁴ captain of the guard‚'' but less correctly.-Secun-
dum gradum imperii. “The second rank in the empire.”—Sequc
ostendit velle. “And informed him that he wished.’'—-Sine hoc.
“Without this,” i. e.‚ without going through this form of application.
Observe that Izoc is neuter herc. Some make hoc masculine, and
refer it to the chiliarchus, ‘⁴ without him.”

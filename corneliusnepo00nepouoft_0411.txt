Censor. He was elected to this office in B.C. 184, notwithstand-
ing the combined opposition os six other candidates. His colleague,
whom he brought in by his own influence, was L. Valerius Flaccus
his former colleague in the consulship—Severe proefuz't ci potestati.
“Exercised that magistracy with great strictness.'‘ He had been
loud in his promises or threats of reform, and declared that, ifin-
vested with this office, he would not belie the professions os his past

who were notorious sor their luxury, and all who derived profit from

amounted to ignominia, not to infamia, and might be removed by
the next censors or by a law—Et multas res ηουαε, διο. “And he

during his time of office, and to have directed attention to those
matters which he required to be or not to be done. Originally every

his predecessors in office were adopted as precedents, according to
which he intended to act. Cato, therefore, while he adopted those
of preceding censors‚ added some new ones oshis own.

Circitcrper annos octoginta ‚· butas Cato died at the age ofeighty-five‚
this would make him to have turned his attention to public affairs
as early as the age offive years ! A singular instance osprecocity.
WVe have rejected the words in question, therefore, as an absurd in·
terpolation. Bremi thinks that the MSS. may perhaps have been
altered from LXX. to LXXX„ but this hardly helps the matter.—
Reipublicoe causa. To which Nepos might also have added private
hate—Tenemus. “Though attacked.” He was accused no less
than sorty-sour times during the course ofhis life, and his enemies
only once prevailed against him. This was aster liis censorship,

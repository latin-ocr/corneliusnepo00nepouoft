os Melcarth,’' and Melearth was the tutelary deity os the Tyrians.
called by the Greeks Hercules—Hannibalis. The Hannibal here
meant was the grandfather of the celebrated opponent of the Ro-
mans—Bareas. This name is supposed to be related to the Hebrew
Barak, and to signify “lightning.”—Primo Punico bello. “In the
first Punic war.’' This war lasted from BC. 265 to 242. The
Carthaginians, on account of their Phoenician origin, were some-
times called Poem· or Puni, from which appellation the adjective
Poenicus or Punicus is derived—Temporibus extremis. “Toward

suddenly landed on the northern coast os Sicily, and established him-
self, with his whole army, on a mountain named Herae, which hc
held, to the astonishment of both friends and soes, sor nearly three
years. When at length he relinquished his position, it was only to
occupy the still more extraordinary and galling one of Mount Eryx,
sor two years more.

Lacessivit. “He attacked them.'‘—Erycem. “Eryx‚'' a steep
and isolated mountain in the northwest os Sicily, near Drepanum

Persuasit. ‘⁴ He convinced.’' Persuaden, followed by ut and the
subjunctive, means “to persuade to ;'’ but when followed by the in-
finitive preceded by an accusative, “to convince.'’ (Zumpt, ᾧ 615.)
--Insmz‘tum bellum. “ An endless war,’' i. e., a war osextermination.
-Nz’liilo magis. “ Notwithstanding.'’—Insidiarum. “Of treach-
ery.'’—Colloquium ejus. “A conferenee with him.”—Beneficiis mu-
tuis. It would have been better to have said benevolentia mutua,
since he had actually bestowed benefits upon Datames, as has al-
ready been stated in the text.—Contz'neri. “ To ‘be held together,‘’

CHAPTER XI.

§1,2.

Ad. Namely, that he hated the king as much as Datames did.—
Confirmasse. ‘⁶ Had confirmed‚⁷’ i. e.‚ had made it a matter of posi
tive beliefon the part osDatames—Cerciorcmsacit. “ He informs.'’
—Cum ipso rege. No longer with the neighboring satraps, but with
the king in person—Quo loco vellet. For in eo loco, in quo vellet
in colloquium venire.

Fidem. “ Confidence.’‘-Ame aliquot dics. ‘⁴ Some days before.”
This is not correct, according to the usual practice os the best wri-
ters. It should be rather aliquot diebus ante. The expression ante
aliquot dies means, properly, ‘⁴ some days ago‚'⁷ with reference to the
speaker.—Obruit. ‘⁸ Conceals” or “covers over.’'—Diligentcr notat.
⁴‘ Caresully mai·ks.”— Utrique. Strictly speaking, utrique, in the plu-
ral, is used only when each of two parties consists os several indi-
viduals ; in accordance with which rule, not only Datames and Mith-
radates would be here meant, but their sollowers also. But as even
good prose writers now and then use the plural utrique in speaking
os only two persons or things, it is better to make Nepos refer here
to Datames and Mithradates merely. (Compare Timol, ii„ 2;
Zumpt, ζ) 141, n. 2.)—Quz' csrplorarcne. ‘⁶ To examine.”-—-Ipsos seru-
iurentur. ‘⁴ To search themselves,'' i. c., Datames and Mithradates.

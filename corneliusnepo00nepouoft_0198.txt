stance—Quod εόεἰείαιεηι scczsset. “Because he had (as they al-
leged) made an agreement.'' Literally, ‘⁵ an alliance.” The sub-
J'unctive is here employed, because the opinion or sentiments of
others, not os the writer himself, are stated. It is said that the
Spartans, in their search to discover more traces of the plot of
Pausanias, found a letter of Themistocles, from which it was evi-
dent that he was acquainted with his plans. The truth appears to
have been, however, that Pausanias, when he saw Themistocles
banished‚ believing that he would embrace any opportunity of aveng-
ing himself on his ungrateful country, opened his project to him in
a letter. Themistocles thought it the scheme of a madman‚ but one
which he was not bound and had no inducement to reveal. (Thirt-
wall, Hist. Gr.‚ ii., p. 384.)

The inhabitants of this island were under obligations to him for his
friendly mediation in a dispute with Corinth about the Leucadian
peninsula, and had by this means obtained the object they contended
for. We have already alluded to the error of Nepos (chapter i1.,
9 1) in making a war to have prevailed between the Corcyreans and
Athenians, and in representing Themistocles as the conqueror of
the former—Principes. “The leading men.''—Time3re ne. The
verbs timeo, metuo, and vereor are followed by ne when any thing is
to be prevented, or when it is wished that something should noc
happen, and by uc when it is wished that something should take
place—Propter se. ‘⁶ On his account.⁷' Observe that se refers to
Themistocles, the subject of animadvertisset, the leading verb in
the sentence. Hence, too, we have his immediately aster, referring
to the Corcyreans, not sibi.—M‹3lossorum. The Molossi were a peo-
ple of Epirus, and the most powerful in that country. Their king,
Admetus, was reputed to be a descendant of the son of Achilles.—
Cum quo ei hospitium suerat. “With whom he had had a guest-

says, that, aster having been stripped os his wealth by the Thracians
in Bithynia, he determined to go to Artaxerxes, and implore his pro-
tection, imagining that the king, upon trial, would find him not less
serviceable than Themistocles had been ; and that he had a better
· claim to his patronage; sor he was not going to solicit the king⁷s
aid against his countrymen‚ but sor his country against its worst
enemies. Pharnabazus, he concluded‚ was likely to procure him a
safe conduct; and he therefore went to him in Phrygia, where he
stayed some time, making his court to him, and receiving marks os
respect—In Asiam. Nepos makes him cross over from Thrace into
Asia; Plutarch makes him pass from Bithynia, a province of Asia,
into Phrygia, another province.

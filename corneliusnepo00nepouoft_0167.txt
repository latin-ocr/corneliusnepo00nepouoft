Quam vidirent ..... si animadverterent. The sceing and per-
eeiving expressed by video and animadverto are, as Daehne remarks,
contemporaneous with desperari and audi-ri, and also continuous.
Hence we have the imperfect, not the pluperfect os the subjunctive.
—De eorum virtute non desperari. “That there was no despair of
their valor‚'' i. e.‚ on the part of their commanders. Observe that
desperari is here used impersonally ; so also auderi at the end of the
clause. In place of eorum we would naturally expect sua here,
such being the regular construction. But, as Bremi remarks, Nepos
purposely uses eorum, and thus refers the opinion respecting the
valor of the Athenians to the minds of their commanders, making
quum viderent equivalent in spirit to quum appar-iret ex agendi ratione
praetorum, in order to bring out in more lively colors the opposite
clause, namely, the conviction entertained by the enemy themselves,
‘⁴ si animadverterent auderi adversus se.'’-Eci<lcm re. “From the
same cause.”—Andcri dimicare. “That it was dared to engage,‘'
ι’. a, that they dared to engage.

Hoc in tempore. “During this conjuncture.” The preposition m
is here expressed with tompus, to denote not merely the time, but
a continuing state, a time of difficulty, a critical period or crisis.
The simple ablative would denote merely a momentary period. So
that tempus here, as Daehne remarks, is equivalent to the Greek
acacp6s.——-Plataecnses. “The Plataeans.” These were the inhabit-
ants of Plataeae, atown of Boeotia, at the soot os Mount Cithaeron.
The place was under the protection os Athens, and hence gratitude
prompted the aid which they sent on this occasion—Ea. “ That
state.’⁷ supply civitas, which is implied by Flammea-imm mizz-
tum. Observe that mille is here used substantively, and, of course,
takes the genitive. (Zumpt, 6 116, note.) J ustin agrees with Nepos
in making the number of Plataean auxiliaries one thousand. He-
rodotus makes no mention of the amount. It probably did not ex-
ceed six hundred heavy-armed men. (Thirlwalffs Grcecc, chap. xiv.)
. Deoem millia armatorum completa sunt. “Ten thousand armed
rnen were made up‚’' i. e.‚ there were ten thousand heavy-armed
men complete. The number of Athenians in this battle is uni-
formly rated at about ten thousand; but it probably falls short of
the trum, and certainly does not take the slaves into account, who
served most likely as light-armcd troops. Thc Persian army, on

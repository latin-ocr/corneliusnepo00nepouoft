direction from Athens—Ab oppido. “ From the city.'’- Athens is
meant. The more usual torm sor a capital is urbs. Nepos, how-
ever, often uses oppidum in speaking osa capital. He employs urbs,
in speaking of Athens, only on two occasions, namely, Mile„ v., 1,
and Themi-et„ vii., 5.—Gircicer millia passuum decem. “About ten
miles.” Literally, “about ten thousand paces.’' One thousand

paces made a Roman mile. Nepos is wrong here ; the distance is
nearly twice as great.

Tumullu. The instrumenta} ablative, depending on permoti. Tu·
multus has here the meaning 0f“an alarm.⁷’ It properly denotos
any sudden and unexpeeted occurrence, that causes confusion and
alarm. As a war, it is one that breaks out suddenly and violent-
ly, and is therefore more to be feared than bellum—Permoti. “Be—
ing greatly startled.''——Lacedaembniz's. “The Lacedaemonians.’'
The inhabitants os Lacedaemon or Sparta, the capital of Laconia.—
Plzidz'ppidem. “Phidippides.⁷‘ This is a name by no means un-
common among the Greeks ; still, however, as it comes from φεὶὁο-
μαι, “to spare‚” and ἵππος, “ a horse,’⁷ and means, therefore, “ Horse-
sparer,’⁷ Daehne thinks that it may here, perhaps, indicate a species
of runner, and form an apposition with cursorem. It seems better,
however, to regard it as a mere proper name.

ἡμεροδρόμοι. “ Βεγ-Υυηῃει·5.” From ἡμέρα, “ a day‚'⁷ and δραμεῖν
(2 aor. inf. of τρέχω), “to run.’' The persons here meant were a
kind of couriers, who could run all day long, and traverse great dis-
tanees during that period. Hence Livy (xxxi., 24) says of thern:
“Hemerodrdmos vocant Groeci, ingens die uno cursu emetientcs spa-
tium.” Properly speaking, the relative in the text should refer to
generis, so that the regular form of expression would have been,
“quod ἡμεροδρόμων vocatur‚'’ but Nepos here refers the relative to
the explanatory substantive which follows, namely, ἡμεροδρόμοι.
(Zumpt, ς) 372.)—Ut nunciaret. The more common form ofexpres-
sion would be qui nuntiaret. But ut is not unfrequently found in
such cases, especially where, as in the present instance, qui has
already Just preceded—Quam celeri opus essct auxilio. “Of how
speedy assistance there was need.’' The subjunctive is here em
p'loyed because the language of another is indirectly quoted.

The term praetor is contracted from jamnor, and means, literally.

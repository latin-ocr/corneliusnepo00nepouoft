PREFACE. 137

(Zumpt, ς) 398.) Lacedaemon was the capital of Laconia, and was
also called Sparta.

Ad coenam mercede condictam. “To an entertainment agreed upon
at mutual expense.” The reference is to what we call a picnz'e feast,
where all contribute to a common meal. Such feasts were called,
in Greek, ἔρανοι. Mercede has here the force ofimpemct, arising from
that of damnum, in explanation os w'hich peculiar meaning of tho
term, consult Moser's note on Cic„ Tusa, iii., 6, 12. The common
text has ad scenam mercede conducta, which is plainly erroneous
since women at Lacedaenion were expressly forbidden by a law ot
Lycurgus to attend theatrical exhibitions. And besides, even if
this were not so, what could mercede conducta mean in such a con-
nection'l Certainly not to appear on the stage, since female ac-
tors were unknown among the Greeks. Vv'e have not hesitated,
therefore, to adopt the elegant emendation recommended by Goerenz,
ad Cic„ de Fz'n„ ii„ 20, p. 217.

Olympia‚'’ i. e.‚ at the Olympio games. These games were cele-
brated at Olympia in Elis. The victor was proclaimed by a herald.
Observe that Olympiae is the locative case, like Lacedoemom' in ᾧ 4.

these things.”—Plertique sunt decbra. “A great many things are

cimbra—Quem enim Romanorum pudet. “For what one of the Ro-
mans does it shamew z'. e.‚ what one seels ashamcd. For the ac-

CHAPTER 1.
φ 1.

Thrasybfflus, Lyci-filius, Atheniensis. These words sorm a speeies
of title, like those at the commencement of the bIOgraphy os The-
mistocles. Obsorvc that Thrasybulus has the long penult, the Greek
form of the name being Θρασύὸουλος.-Αίήεηίεηεῑζς, He was a native

intrusted by Lysander, aster the close of the Peloponnesian war.—
Ex servitute in libertatem vindicaret. “He delivered out os slavery

into freedom,” i. e.‚ he rescued from servitude and restored to free-

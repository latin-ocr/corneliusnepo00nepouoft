Dion procured sor him great distinction among the Greeks. (Plut.‚
Vit. Dion, c. 15.)-Id se non odio hominis, &c. Plutarch says that
Dionysius insormed the friends os Dion that the latter was not gone
into exile, but only sent abroad for a time, lest his stubborn sels-will
should draw upon him a heavier punishment.

Postea vero quum audivit, &c The statement here made by Nepos
is an erroneous one. Dion did not commence warlike operations
against Dionysius until he had been goaded into that measure by
the tyranny of the latter. Dionysius first stopped his remittances,
and put his estate into the hands oshis own stewards3 and then he
made an insulting proposal to Dion, through Plato, to give Arete,
the wife of Dion, in marriage to another. Nepos's account is, like
some of the others given by him, too favorable to the tyrann—Areten.

and the whole clause is equivalent to nullum tempus ci relinquebatur,
quo sobrius essct. On this construction of relinquitur, licet, &c., with
the dative and infinitive, consult Zumpt, 9 601.

tarch says that the son, who was now a large boy, upon some child-

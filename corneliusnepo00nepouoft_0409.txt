to B.C. ziz-Tribunus militum. ‘⁸ A tribune os the soldier-s,’' i. e.,
a military tribune. This was a legionary officer, who derived his
name from the earlier times of the Roman commonwealth. Accord-
ing to Varro, a legion originally consisted os three thousand men,
one thousand being supplied by each tribe, and the quota os each
tribe was commanded by a tm'hunus. Asterward‚ when the numbers
os the legion increased, that os the tribuni increased msc, and be-
came commonly six, each tribunus generally commanding one thou-
sand men in battle—Castra secutus est. “He followed the camp‚'’
i. e., attached himself to the command or army—Magni oestimata
est. “XVas highly valued.'’—Apud Senam. Sena was a town on
the coast os Umbria, at the mouth oftbc small river Sena, not sar

Quoestor obtigit Publio Africano. “As quaestor, he fell by lot to
Publius Africanus.'’ Scipio Africanus Major is meant. This was
in B.C. 205. The quaestors drew lots for their respective appoint-
ments. They were, in effect, the paymasters osthe army—Cum quo
mon, &c. “With whom he did not live according to the intimate
connection os his office,’' i. e.‚ on that friendly and intimate footing
which should exist between one, whose station has been assigned
him by lot, and his superior officer. The operation of the lot in
such a case was believed to produce a tie like that of intimate re-
lationship. —AEdilis plebis. “AEdile of the commons‚'’ i. e„ ple-
beian aedile. This was in B.C. 199. There were two classes of
aediles, the plebeian and curule. The former were chosen from
the plebeiam, the latter at first from the patricians, asterward al-
ternately from the two orders, and, at last, indifferently from both.
The ordinary number sor a long time was four, namely, two ple-
beian and two curule. These magistrates had the superintendence
os the streets, the care and erection of public buildings, temples,
&c.‚ the control os the markets, the exhibition of public games,
and other similar duties.

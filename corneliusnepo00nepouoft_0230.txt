nians.‘' Hospitium among the Greeks and Romans was either pub·
lic or private, and the former, again, was either between two states,
or between an individual or a family on the one hand, and a whole
state on the other. In the present instance it was between Cimon
and the Spartan state.— Urebatur. In the indicative, because the
matter referred to is mentioned as an historical fact by Nepos.—
C'ontcndcrc Laccdaemfmcm. “ To hasten to Lacedaemon.'’ The mean-
ing is, that Cimon, after having been recalled from exile, thought it
better to go, in the first instance, to Lacedaemon, before he returned
to Athens, and endeavor to settle the war between the two states
by his persona] influence. He took this step os his own accord (sua
sponte), without having received any orders from home for that pur-
pose, and he relied on his guest—friendship with the Spartans for a
friendly reception by them. Lambinus, regarding the whole passage
as mutilated, inserts, apparently on his own conjecture, a whole
clause after existimans, and at the same time changes the pointing.
He reads, therefore, as follows: satius existimans, cos ct cives suos
inter sc voluntale consentire, qnam armis contendere, Laccdoemonem sua
sponte ess-t profectus. This, however, is altogether unnecessary, since
the meaning of the passage is clear enough.

§4-

Post, ncque ita multo. “Asterward, and not so long (afterward
either)‚’' i. e., not very long after this. Compare, as regards this
form of expression, Vit. Paus„ chapter iii.‚ ᾧ l.-Cyprum missus.
Cimon sailed with his fleet to assist the Egyptian king Amyrtaeus‚
He sent on a squadron of sixty galleys to the aid of Amyrtaeus‚ and
with the rest laid siege to Citium in Cyprus, one of the dependen-
cies of the King of Persia-In morbum implicitus. Another form of
expression would have been morbo implicitus. Plutarch says that
according to most authors, Cimon died a natural death during the
siege of Citium. Some, however, he adds, make him to have died
os a wound which he received in an engagement with the barbari-
ans. Diodorus Siculus (xii, 4) and Thucydides (i., 112) agree with
Nepos as to the manner os his death—In oppido Citio. 'Thucydides
and Plutarch make him to have died, not in the city of Citium, but
while bcsieging that place. Diodorus Siculus, on the other hand.
makes the place to have been taken by Cimon. Citium was one of
the most ancient cities of Cyprus, and was situate on the southern
shores of the island, northeast of Amathus. It was the birth-place
of Zeno, the founder os the Stoic sect. The site os the ancient citi
corresponds to that os the modern Chiti.

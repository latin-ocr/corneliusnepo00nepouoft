Line or* DION. 273

Graec1a that had been under the sway of the elder Dionysius, and
was still held by his son. The terms offered by the younger Diony-
sius, on this occasion, are given differently by Plutarch. According
to this writer, Dionysius offered to surrender the citadel to Dion on
condition that he might be permitted to retire into Italy, aud there
enjoy the revenues of Gyata, a sruitsul tract of country in the terri-
tory os Syracuse. The proposal was lest to the Syracusans, who
refused to accede to it ; whereupon the tyram, leaving Apollocrates,
who was his eldest son, to defend the citadel, embarked with his
most valuable treasures and escaped to Italy —Cuz' maximam fidem,
&c. The common text has Dion aster habebat, which is manifestly
a salse reading, since it was not Dion, but Dionysius, who placed the
greatest eonfidenee in Apollocrates. Lambinus therefore substi-
tutes Dionysius, which is sanctioned by several MSS„ and os which
the Dion of the common text is evidently a mere abbreviation. But
Dionysius itself savors of the copyist, and we have therefore rejected
it with Bremi, and made the sentence end with hahebat, the refer-
ence to Dionysius being sufficiently implied by the context.

Suam vim exercuit. “ She exercised her violence.”—In filio. ‘⁴ In
the case of his son.'’ Compare chapter iv, 0 3, seqq.—Reduzisset.
‘⁶ H'e had taken back again.” To complete the idea, we may here
supply in matrimonium. Compare Suetonius, Vit. Domit.‚ e. viii„
where the full form of expression is given, “ Ob reductam in matri-
monium uxorem.’'—Quae alii fuerat tradita. She had been given in
·marriaga to Timocrates, as already stated. s ompare chapter iv.,
§3.—A perdita luxuria. “From abandoned dissoluteness.”—-Accepit
gravissimum, &c. The order is, parens accepit gravissimum vulnus
morta (sui)filz'i. ⁴·

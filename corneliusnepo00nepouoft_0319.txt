Agr-esti duplici amiculo, &c. “ Clad in a rustic double cloak and
¹a coarse tunic.'’ The term duplici refers merely to the solding or
doubling of the amiculum, not to its texture. Observe, moreover‚
that duplici makes with amiculo merely one idea, and therefore no
connecting particle is required after agresti. Compare Eam„ xiii,
4: ‘⁸ militari honestofanerc‚·” and C'aes.‚ B. G„ i., 18: “Praelz'um eques-

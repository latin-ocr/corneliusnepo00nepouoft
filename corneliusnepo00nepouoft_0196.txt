Profitiri is to declare openly and before all, being equivalent to pro

Χ omnibusfatcri.—Quotl communiyure gentium, &c. ‘⁵ (A thing) which,

(he maintained), they could do by virtue of the common right os na-
tions.’' Quod refers to deos publicos, &c., muris sepsisse. Observe‚
moreover, the force of the subjunctive in possent, as indicating the
opinion and sentiments of Themistocles—Deos publicos, suosque pa-
trios ac penales. “The public gods (of Greecc)‚ as well as their
own country's gods and household deities.” By Deos publicos are
meant the deities worshipped throughout Greece, such as Jupiter,
Juuo, Apollo, διο. By Deos patrios, the national deities of Attica are
meant, especially Minerva, the tutelary deity os Athens—Quosacz'l-
ius possent. The subjunctive, because quo is equivalent herc to
ut—Sepsisse. From sepia—Quod essct. “What was, (in his opin-
ion).’' Observe the subjunctive, as indicating the opinion os the
speaker.

Nam illorum urbem, διο. The main subject os the proposition is
urbem, and we should therefore expect oppositam,· the Latius, how-
ever, are accustomed to connect the participle with the predicate,
or, as in the present instance, with the apposition (propugnaculum),
when this contains the stronger notion. Compare Daclme, ad loc„
and Zumpt, ᾧ aea—Apud quam jam his. The allusion is to Mara-

the phrase secisse naufragium may apply to it in common with Sal-
amis, since naufragium facere not only means to suffer shipwreck,
to be unlucky at sea, but is also figuratively applied to any great
loss or overthrow. Compare Ernesti, Clav. Cic„ s. v. naufragium.
—Fecisse. ‘We would expect here fecisset, since it is, in fact, an
oratio obliqua from apud quam to the end os thc sentence. Some-
imes, however, the infinitive is found, especially where a relative
may be resolved into a conjunction with the demonstrative (as apud
quam into et apud lianc). This is an imitation of the Greek idiom.

Qui id potius intuerentur. “Since they rather regarded that.'‘
The subjunctive is here employed, because the reason or ground os
what precedes is given. (Zumpt, ζ) 564.)--Rccipcre. ‘⁶ To receive
back.‘’—Quos Athenas miserant. The indicative, because an histor-
ical fact is stated by the writer-Se remitterent. “They should
send him back.”—Al›iter illos numquam in patriam recepturi. ‘⁴ Being

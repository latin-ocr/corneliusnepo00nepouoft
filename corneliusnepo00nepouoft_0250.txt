place. Alcibiades, the encmy os Sparta, wished to return to Athone
He accordingly entered into correspondence with the most inssu

ential persons in the Athenian fleet at Samos, offering to bring ove

TiSsaphernes to an alliance with Athens, but making it a condition
that oligarchy should be established there. This coinciding witi
the wishes os those with whom hc was negotiating‚ those politica
movements wcrc set on soot by Pisander which ended in the estab

lishment of the Four Hundred. The oligarchs, however, finding that
he could not perform his promise with respect to Tissaphernes, and
conscious that he had at heart no real liking for an oligarchy‚ would
not recall him. But the soldiers in the armament at Samos, headed
by Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, declared thbir resolution to restore
democracy, and passed a vote by which Alcibiades was pardoned
and recalled, and appointed one os their generals.

generally, “to make interest in one's behalf,” dac. Theramenes

This was aster the battle os Cyzicus, in which the Peloponnesians
lost their whole fleet. This disaster created so much alarin at
Sparta, that an embassy was sent to Atheus to make overtures sor
peace. The offer was rejected through the influence osa demagogue
named cleophon—Tribus navalibus. The three naval victories here
referred to werc those os Cynossima, Abydos, and Cyzicus.

, 5. Epistolce ad Ciceronem, from one of which Lactan-
tiusl has preserved an extract ; but we can not tell wheth-
er they were ever formally collected into a volume.

6. De Historz'cis. This is alluded to in the Life of Dion,²
which now bears the name of Cornelius Nepos.

The work styled “Vitae Imperatorum‚'’ which has be-
come so popular a school-book, not being mentioned by any
ancient writer, was sor a long time attributed to AEmilius
Probus, who lived in the fourth century, and who in the MSS.
appears as having presented a copy of the book to the Em-
peror Theodosius I., and having prefixed to it some verses,
in which he seems to claim the authorship. Accordingly,
the earlier editions of the ‘⁴ Vitce Imperatorum” were en-
titled “ Probi AEmz‘lz'z' Excellentizcm Imperatorum Vitce.''
But afterward the critics began to question the claims of
Probus to the authorship of the work. The style, and espe-
cially the sentiments of the lives, certainly appear not suit·
ed to a writer of the age of Theodosius, such as the mani-
fest disapprobation of a monarchical government, which is
exhibited in many passages among others, in the lives of
Timoleon and Dion. It is remarkable that the author in
the preface addresses the work to Atticus ; and yet, at the
end of the life of Hannibal, when speaking of the uncer-
tainty about the date of that great commander’s death, he
says that “ Atticus, in his ‘ Chroniclc,’ had left it written
(‘ scriptum reliquis) that Hannibal died during the eon-
sulship of Μ. O. Marcellus and Q. F. Labeo ;’' speaking
thus of Atticus as of a person deceased.

After the first editions of the “ Vitce Impe2·ator2mz” were
published, Petrus Cornerus found, in an old MS. containing -
the letters os Cicero to Atticus, the life of Atticus, and the
short notice of Cato the Censor. These two biographies
were published together with the “Vitce Imperatorum,'’
and the whole under the name of AEmilius Probus, contrary

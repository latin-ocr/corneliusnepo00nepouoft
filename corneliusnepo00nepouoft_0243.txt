Pericli. The genitive. Consult note on Vic. Themisti„ chapter i.
0 1.—Priv2'gnus.' “A step-son.” This is an error. Pericles, ac*
cording to Diodorus Siculus and other authorities, was the uncle
of Alcibiades. The latter became an orphan at a very early age,
and was placed under the wardship of Pericles-Hipponicum. Hip-,
ponicus belonged to the Athenian family of Callias and Hipponicus‚
celebrated sor its wealth‚ and which was so called because the heads
of it received these names alternately in successive generati-ons.
They enj0yed the hereditary dignity os torch-bearer at the Eleusin-
ian mysteries, and claimed descent srom Triptolemus. The daugh-
ter os Hipponicus, whom Alcibiades married, was named Hipparete,
and he received with her a dowry of ten talents, which was to be
doubled on the birth osa son. His marriage took place before the
battle of Delium (Bc. 424), in which Hipponicus was slain. As
Pericles married his divorced wife, the error of Nepos in making
the latter the step-father of Alcibiades may have arisen in this way.

Omnium Groecci lingua, &c. There can be no doubt but that this
is the true reading. The common text has Omnium Groecoe lingum
eloquentia ditissimum, which is almost unintelligible. The form di-
vitissimus is the usual one in the prose of Cicero, and the shorter
one ditissimus in poetry and the later prose writers. (Zumpt, ᾧ 102,
‘noce 1.)-Sz' ipse fingere vellet, διο. “If he himself had wished to
contrive it, he would not have been able either to think of more ad-
vantages‚ or to attain unto greater ones‚'’ &c. On this usage of the
imperfect (vellet, posset) where we would cxp'ect the pluperfect (vo-
luisset, potuisset), consult Zumpt, ᾧ 525.

Peloponnbsio. The more usual form would have been Peloponne-
εἱᾶεο, but Nepos appears to have had a preference for Polopomzesius.

consilio atque auctoritate, διο. This was in Bc. 415. Alcibiades
was the soremost among the advocates of the Sicilian expedition,
which his ambilion led him to believe would be a step toward the
conquest of Italy, Carssrage, and the Peloponnesus.

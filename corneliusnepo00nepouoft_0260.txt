on Vit. Lysand.‚ chapter iv.‚ ᾧ 1.—Clemcntz'am. “The claims os
humanity.'' Alcibiades, as Bremi remarks, had come to Pharna-
bazus as a fugitive, and the kind and humane treatment which the
latter had extended toward him is here not unaptly termed clemen-
tia. Observe‚ inoreover, that violare is here employed in the active,
because the reference is to an immediate act, and minui in the pass-
ive, because alluding to what is more remote—Opes. “ The inter-
ests.⁷'—Susamz'thren ec Bagaeum. Plutarch calls the latter Magaeus,
and makes him to have been the brother os Pharnabazus, while he
stylos Susamithres the uncle ofthe latter. The reading Bagacum,
however, is generally preferred, since it is thought to mean “a
eunuch,'’ and to be not a proper but a common noun. We have
written it, however, as a proper name—In Phrygia. Plutarch says
hc was residing at the time in a small village in Phrygia—Iterquc
. . . compararet. The more usual form would have been pararet,-
Daehnc, however, says that compararet is more expressive.

merely states that he wrapped his robe about his lest hand (or arm),

—Familiaris sui subalare telum cripuit. ‘⁴ He snatched a dagges Os a
friend os his.'' The epithet subalarz's means properly, “under the
arm-pit‚'' and hence “ under the arni'' generally. It is here used
os what is carried under the arrn, a short dagger, &a The deriva-
tion is sub, and ala, “ tho arm-pit.‘’ The verb cripuit properly means
here that he snatched the weapon out os his sriend's hand, and it is
therefore much stronger than arripuit would have been—Quidam ez

that by his very appearance he inspired every one with admiration
of him. Literally‚ “ cast into every one an admiration ofhimself.”

Sed in labore, &c “But in laborious employments he was too
soon tired out, and but little accustomed to endurance.‘’ This only
apparently contradicts what is stated in chapter i., since one might
have all the advantage-s and qualities there described, and yet lie

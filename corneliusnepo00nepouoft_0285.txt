CHAPTER IV.

Qui quidem. Referring to Dionysius. Compare, as rega? ds the ini-
tial qui, the commencement os Q 2, chap. ii.-Auctoritate. “WVeight
os character,” i. e„ influence—Aliquam occasionem, &c. “He (Dio-
nysius) might afford him some opportunity of crushing himseIs‚”
i. e., of dethroning him. Observe that sui and daret both refer to
Dionysius. Plutarch states that Dionysius was gradually prejudiced
against Dion by the artsul insinuations of Philistus and his-party.—
Navcm ei triremem dedit. Plutarch says, that as Dionysius was one
day walking along with Dion under the wall of the citadel‚ near the
sea, the former produced a letter of Dion’s, and grounded upon it a
charge of his having conspired with the Carthaginians against him.
When Dion attempted to speak in his own defence, Dionysius re-
fused to hear him, and, having hurried him on board a fast-sailing
vessel (ἀκάτιον), he ordered the mariners to carry him off and land
him on the coast of Italy. (Plut.‚ Vic. Dion, c. 14.)

Corinthum. Corinth was a celebrated commercia] city of Greece,
situate on the isthmus of the same name—Devehcretur. ‘³ He might
be conveyed.”—Quum inter se timerent. “Since they Were afraid
os one another.” In such a construction as this, there is, properly,
as Bremi remarks, an ellipsis of the reciproca] pronoun, the full form
of expression being quum se inter se timcrcnc.——Altcrutcr alterum
praeoccuparet. “The one might make away with the other before
he was on his guard.‘’ The verb praeoccupare properly means “to
take possession of something before another.” then employed in
speaking of men, it signifies “ to anticipato one‚'' and then has the
meaning which we have here assigned to it. Compare Bremi‚ adloc.

Id factum. “ At this proceeding.”—lllagnaeque essct invidio: tyran-
no. “And brought great odium upon the tyrant.” Observe the
double dative—Omnia quoe moveri poterant Dionis. “All the prop-
erty of Dion that could be moved,” i. e.‚ all the movables of Dion.
Plutarch's account is somewhat different from this. That writer
states that Dionysius allowed the friends os Dion two ships, that
they might dispatch to him in the Peloponnesus as much os his treas-
ure and as many of his slaves as they might wish. For Dion, he
adds, was a man os great wealth, and had lived at Syracuse in al-

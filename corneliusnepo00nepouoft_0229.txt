unilt with the treasure. Many of the splendid improvements, how-
ever, which Cimon made in Athens, were effected at his own cost.
The walls, for instance, from the city to the harbors of Piraeeus and
phalarum, were commenced‚ and in great part executed, at his own
expense. He changed also the Academy from a barren, unculti-
vated field to a shady and pleasant grove, and planted the Agora
with plane-trees.

CHAPTER 111.

Quum unus in civitate, &c Compare notes on Vic. Milt„ chapter
i., ᾧ 1.—Quam pater suus, &a For in quam pater εαιιε, &c., incide-
rant. An ellipsis of a preposition with the relative pronoun, together
with an ellipsis of the verb which preceded with the demonstrative,
is os frequent occurrence in Latin, Here, besides in, we are to sup-
ply inciderant. (Zumpt, Q 778.)—Tcstarum suffragiis. Compare
notes on Vic. Themi-st„ chapter viii.. Q l.—Quod illi ὀστρακισμὸν vo-
cant. “What they call the ostracism.” Quod in the neuter here
forms a harsh construction, since testarum suffragiis precedes, to
which it should refer back, and also since the Greek noun ὀστρακισ-
αός is of the masculine gender. We have expressed it, therefore,
by a somewhat analogous idiom in our own language. Bremi ex-
plains it by an ellipsis ofjudiciz' genus before quocL—Dcccm annorum
exsilio multatus est. The insulting manner in which the services of
the Athenians were rejected by the Lacedaemonians, when the
former, under the command os Cimon, came to their aid at the siege
os Ithome, B.C. 464 and 461, seems to have put the Athenians in
ill humor with all the friends of Sparta, and this may have had some
effect in bringing about Cimon‘s exile.

ᾧ 2.

Animo forti. “With a gallant spirit.”—-Confestim. Cimon was
banished toward the end osBC. 461, and in 457 the Athenians were
signally worsted by the Lacedaemonians at Tanagra, in Boeotia.
This was followed by other defeats, and hence the desire sor his
return.—Consecucum est. ‘⁴ Ensued.'’ Taken intransitively.

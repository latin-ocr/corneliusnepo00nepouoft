Δαρεῖος.-Εατ Αεέᾰ in Eurbpam exercitu trajecto, &Q ‘⁵ Remlved, an
army having been transported from Asia into Europe, to make war‚’'
&c. This is the same as saying, “Resolved to tran-spon an army
from Asia into Europe, aml make war,’' so that the absolute clause
supplies the place of an infinitive clause. Herodotus says that the
⁸number of the king's army on this expedition was seven hundred
thousand men. (Herod, i.. 87.) They crossed from Asia to Europe

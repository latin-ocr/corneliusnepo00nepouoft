never otherwise about to receive them back again into their native
country,‘’ i. e., since on no other terms would they ever get their
own ambassadors back again. The ordinary text has essent before

namely, Argos, neuter; but in the plural it has Argi, orum, &c., of
the second declension, declined regularly, Dachne makes Argos

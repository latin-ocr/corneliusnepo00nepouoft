1. MILTIADES.

CHAPTER I.

Μίίιῐᾶάεε, Oimfmz‘s filius, &c “When Miltiades, son of Cimon,
the Athenian, was alone of all making the greatest figure both for
the antiquity oshis family, and the glory of his ancestors, and his
own unassuming ‹leportment.” Literally, ‘⁶ was flourishing most.⁷'
The numeral unus is added to superlatives to strengthen their mean-
ing, and hence the idea here is that Miltiades was making by far
the greatest figure os all. Nepos, in this biography‚ confounds the
younger with the elder Miltiades. Consult the concluding note on
this life.—Antiqu2'eate generis. The family of Miltiades came orig-
inally from the island os sEgina, lying off the southwestern coast of
Attica, and claimed descent from AEacns. Codrus, the last king of
Athens, was one os the line—anue essct create. ⁴⁴ And was of that
{gest Ablative of quality. (Zumpt, §cinq—Cives sui. “ His sel-
low-citizens.”—Posscnt jam. ‘⁴ Could now.” Jam is intended here
to mark the time more emphatically, and is therefore placed in the

beginning os the Latin clause.

Talem suturam, &e “That he was going to be such a one, as
they (afterward actually) judged (hini), having become known (to
thern), to be,” i. e.‚ as they afterward actually found him, on his
having become sully known to them, to be. Equivalent to qualem
judicarunt cum esse, quum cognitus esset ab iia—Chersonesum. “To
the Chersonese.'’ The Thracian Chersonese is meant, a peninsula
on the Hellespont, and the quarter from which the Athenians drew
their chief supply os grain. Hence their care to send colonists (co-
limos) thither. Observe that Chersonesum is here the accusative of
“motion toward,'’ and is used without a preposition, like the name
osa town. The presence of the prepositi0n‚ however, would have
'been more regular. (Zumpt, Q 398, note.)

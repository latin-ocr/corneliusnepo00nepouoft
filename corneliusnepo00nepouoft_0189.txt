mre or· THEMISTOCLES. 173

9308.) As regards the construction quem habuit fidelissimum, ob-
servo that the relative here attracts to it the adjective os the antece
dent clause, forming with it a kind os apposition3 and, moreooer,
that fidelissimum quem habuit would have been ambiguous, and might
have signified “ a very faithful one whom he had‚‘’ without imply-
ing that he was the most faithful one. The name of the slave sent
by Themistocles was Sicinnus, and he was the παιδαγωγός, οι· at-
tendant upon his children—Suis verbis. ¹² In his very words.'’
Tbere is a difference between this and suo nomine, which should be
noted. The former expression is used when the messenger gives
the very words of the person sending him ; but suo nomine, ‘¹ in his
name‚‘' where the messenger is authorized to act for another, and
the words to be employed are left to the discretiori of the person
sent—In fuge} csse. “XVere beginning to flee.‘' More literally,
“vvere in a state os flight.⁷'

Qut si discessissent, &c. “And that, if they should get off,” ἀρ.
Observe that qui is here, in the beginning of the sentence, equiva-
lent to et illi. (Zumpt, ᾧ 803.)—Majore cum labore. The preposi-
tion here expresses the aceompanying circumstance.—Longi7zquiore
tempore. The adjective longinquus is most commonly employed in
reference to distance or remoteness. When it is used in speaking
os time, a more protracted period than ordinary is meant. Compare
Herzog, ad Caes„ B. G„ i.‚ 42—ta03 si statim. Observe that quos
is here equivalent to scd cos. (Zumpt, ᾧ 803.)-Ηοσ co valebat.
“This tended to the following point? i. a, this communication on
the part os Themistocles had the following object in view. Liter-
ally, “this had its soree in this direction.”

Ingraeiciis. ‘⁶ Against their wills‚'’ i. e.‚ whether they would or not.
The verb εῦξέτε implies ingratiis already, but the Latin writers osten
employ words of similar or kindred signification for the purposes of
greater clearness or emphasis. Ingraciis is the ablative plural of
ingratia, α, taken adverbially. The singular number occurs first in
Tertullian (de Poen., c. i. ; ib„ c. 2) ; the plural, however, is met with
at an early period, in the ablative form, among the comic writers.
These Writers say “tuis ingratiis,⁷' “ amborum ingratiis ,·'' and then,
at a subsequent period, the adverbial usage comes in. Instances
os this last occur even in Cicero (Or. pro Quint„ c. 143 Or. c. Verr„
iv.‚ 9). A question arises about its form, many editors preferring
ingratis, as give] in several MSQ. There can be no doubt, how-
ever, that ingratiis is the true reading both here and elsewhere. lt

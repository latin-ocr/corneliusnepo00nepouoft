Hujus. Referring to Themistocles—Intermi- “On land.” Terra
alone would have been ‘⁴ by land.'' The text is carelessly worded
here. There was no division of opinion among the Greeks prior to
this, as to their contending with the Persians by land or by sea.
The Greek congress had resolved to make a stand at Thermopylae,
and, at the same time, to guard the northern entrance os the Eu-
boean channel with their fleet.-Dimicari placebat. With velle, cu-
erc, placere, satius putare, δια, the infinitive passive is employed
when the reference is a general one, and it is not stated when or
by whom an action is to be performed, but the infinitive active
when the reference is a special and determinate one—Qui Ther-
mopylas occuparent. ‘⁴ To seize upon Therinopylae,’' i. c.‚ to antici-
pate the Persians by seizing upon it ; such being, in fact, the soree
os occupare. The subjunctive is employed because an intention or
object is stated, qui being in this case equivalent to ut. (Zumpt,
§ 567.)-Tl2ermopylas. Thermopylae was a narrow pass, between
Mount OEta and the sea, leading from Thessaly into Locris, and
thence into central Greece—Longz‘usquc. The conjunctior] que,
and not ee, is here employed, because ct is merely copulative, and
connects things conceived as different, whereas que is adjunctive,
and adds what belongs to, or naturally flows from things. (Zumpt,
ὁ 333.)—Vim hostium non sustinubrunc. This is not quite correct.
They did withstand the soe until a passage over Mount OEta was
treacherously disclosed to Xerxes. By this pass a body of troops
was brought against the Grecian rear, and soon decided the con,
test—quue in loco, dxc. The conjunction quc, aster a negative
clause, is frequently employed, especially in Nepos, in the sense of
‘⁴ but.” (Bmmi, ad loc.)——-Omncs intericiunt. The army ofLeonidas,
at first, amounted to somewhat more than five thousand. These
fought against the Persians until intelligence came that the passage
over Mount OEta had been made known to the Persians, and that a
body os the latter were on their march to attack them in the rear.
Eeonidas thereupon sent away all the other Greeks except tho
Spartans and Tirespians, the latter refusing to lcpart, and the former
remaining as a matter oscourse. The Spartans were three hundred
in number, the Thespians seven hundred, and it is to these two bod-

les of men that the language os the text must be considered to refer.

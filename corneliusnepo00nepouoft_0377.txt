CHAPTER 1.

Sine dubio magnus. “ Undoubtedly g1·eat.'' These words are to
be taken together.—Quod nescio an nulli. “What perhaps (hap-
pened) to no one else.” There can be no doubt that nulli is here
the true reading, and not ulli, although this last is retained and
sought to be defended by several editors. The expression nescio
an, which properly signifies “I know not, whether not,'’ acquir-ed
eventually the meaning of“ perhaps? and occurs frequently in Cic-
ero with the force os a modest assertion that a particular thing is.
Hence the proprIety ofits being followed by a negative. Compare

lasted sor more than sixty years—Bello vexatam a barbarisque op-
pressam. He refers to the war carried on by the Carthaginians
(here styled “barbarians”) against the elder Dionysius—In pristi
num “To its former condition.‘' Supply statum.

occasion here alluded to), when the state expected another attae-k,
he had the command ossour hundred mercenaries intrusted to him.
—Tyranuidem occupasset. “ Had made himself master os absolute
authority.” Literally. “had seized upon the tyranny.” Plutarch
says that he put to death a number of the principal inhabitants of
Corinth without any form os trial. and declared himself absolute
sovereign.—Possct. ⁴⁴ Ile was ahle‚’' i. e., Timoleon. Observc thc‘

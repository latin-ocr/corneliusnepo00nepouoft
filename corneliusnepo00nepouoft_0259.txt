says that Clearchus, the Spartan leader, received an order from

Haec quum moliretur. ‘⁶ While he was toiling to accomplish these
things.” Molior properly meam, to exert all one's energies, to la-
bor zealously sor the accomplishment os any thing—Critias ceterique
tyranni. Referring to the thirty tyrants placed over Athens by Ly-
sander aster the battle of AEgospotamos and the surrender of the
Athenian capital—Certos homines. ‘⁶ Trusty persons.’'- Qui czcm
certiorem facerent. “ Who should inform liim.’'—Sustulissct. “ He
should take off.”—Fore ratum. “ Would stand good‚” i. e., would
have a firm basis on which to rely.—Suas res gestas manfire. ‘⁴ His
measures to remain unimpai1·ed.’‘ In the expression res gestoe, the
term gestae connects itself so closely with res as to form with it one
idea or substantive notion. Hence we have suas here joined with
it, no‘t α, se, which latter would be correct enough if gestas were
merely regarded as a participle. So, elsewhere, we have the gen?-
tive joined with it, as Vz't. Cat„ iii„ 3, “res gesta: regum ,·’' Vit.
Hann„ xiii„ 3, “Hujus bella gesta.''—Hlum persequeretur. “He
should pursue him to the very last,'’ i. a, should hunt him down ;

Accuratius sibi agendum cum Pharnabazo. “ That he must deal in
a more decided manner with Pharnabazus.’'—Renuntz'at. ¹‘ He an-

nounces.” The verb renuntio has here its true soree, namer, to
announce to another something which has been ordered or com-

missioned to be told.—- Quae regi cum Lacedaemoniz‘s essent irrita
sutura. “That the relations which existed between the king and
the Lacedaemonians will not be likely to last.'’ The expressions
quae mihi cum illo sunt, &c., are osten used to express, as in the
oresent instance, friendly relations.

mm ΛΝΒ wm'rmcs OF NEPOS. ix

to all evidence, as the author of those two biographies speaks
of Atticus as a personal acquaintance. At last Lambinus,
in the commentary to his edition of the “Imperatorum
Vitaess’ in 1568, asserted the claims of Nepos as author ‘of
the whole. But several solecisms and barbarisms which
occur in the “ Vitae’' appearing to invalidate the supposi-
tion of Lambinus, as not being likely to occur in a writer
of the Augustan age, Barth and some other crities have
supposed that Probus abridged the original work of Nepos,
in the same manner as J ustin has epitomized the history of
Trogus Pompeius. This opinion appears the most plausible
of any that have been advanced on the subject, and will,
if properly applied, tend to remove many of the difficulties,
and explain many of the anomalies, by which the question
is embarrassed, more effectually than either of the two
others. It will enable us to account for the purity of the
language, and for the graeeful and unaffected ease of the
clauses, when taken singly, and, at the same time, to un-
derstand the harsh and abrupt transitions which so fre-
quently occur in passing from one sentence or from one para-
graph to another.

The “ Vitae Imperator-affl are short biographies of twen-
ty Greek commanders, and of two Carthaginian‚ Hamilcar
Bareas and Hannibal. To these we have added in the
present edition the short biographical sketch of Cato the
Censor. From a passage at the end of the life of Hanni-
bal, it appears that the author intended to write also the
lives of the great Roman commanders, that their exploits
might be compared with those of the Greek, in order to
judge which were the greater. These lives of the Roman
commanders, if ever written, have not come down to us;
but it seems that some of them at least were written, and,
it would'appear, by Nepos as Plutarch quotes the authority

of Nepos sor facts concerning the lives of Marcellus and
Lucullus.

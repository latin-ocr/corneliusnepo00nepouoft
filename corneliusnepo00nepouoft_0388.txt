alludes here to the great 'revolt os the mercenary troops headed by
Spendius and Matho, which broke out immediately atter their re-
turn from Sicily, and in which they were quickly joined by almost
all the native Africans. This revolt brought Carthage in a moment
to the brink os ruia—Qui fuerant. “who had served as such.”
Supply mentally mercenarii milites.—-Acleo sunt perterriti. “WVere
so exceedingly terrified.'' Observe the sorce osper in composition.
—Auzz'lia. The Romans did not, as Nepos incorrectly states, send
them any auxiliary troops, but aided them in other ways—Extremo.
Hamilcar was not at first employed against the insurgents. XVhether
this arose from the predominance of the adverse party, or that he
was looked upon in some measure as the author ofthe present evils,
from the promises he had been compelled to make to the mercena-
ries under his command, and which there were now no means os
sulfilling, we know not ; but the incapacity os Hanno, who first took
the field against the rebels, soon became so apparent, that all parties
concurred in the appointment of Hamilcar to succeed him.

Is non solum hostes, &c. The forces placed at the disposal of
Hamilcar amounted to only ten thousand men and seventy ele-

* phants; but with these he quickly changed the sace of affairs—A

muris Carthagini& This is incorrect. Carthage itself was not ac-
tually besieged at this time, but all the passes which secured its
communication with the interior were in the hands of the insur-
gents.—Quum amplius centum millia, διο. “W'lien they were be-
come more than a hundred thousand armed men.'’ This number
is exaggerated.—Plures same, &e This was at a later period of
the war, when the insurgents, taking advantage osthe dissensions
among their adversaries, actually ventured to lay siege to Carthage
itself; but Hamilcar, by laying waste the country behind them, and
intercepting their supplies, reduced them to such distrcss that they
were compelled to raise the siege. Spendius now took the field
against Hamilcar, but the latter succeeded in shutting him up, with
his whole army, in a position srom which there was no escape. A
negotiation ensued, but the insurgents, while it was going on, deem-
ing themselves betrayed, rushed to arms, and sorty thousand osthcii
number were slain.-- Uticam. “ Utica,'’ the greatest city of ancient
Africa aster Carthage, situated twenty-seven Roman miles north-
west osthat city—Hipponem. “ Hippo,” a city on the Sinus Hip<
ponensis, west osunen, now Bizerta.

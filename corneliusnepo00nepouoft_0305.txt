Chabrias, Atheniensis. A mere title or inscription sor the lise that
follows. Compare notes on Themist., i.‚ 1, 1.-Hahitus est. “WVas
reckoned.‘’—Scd cx his, &c. “But os these the most conspicuous
is his device,” &c. Literally‚ ‘⁴ shines sorth most.’'—Apud Thebas.
“Near Thebes.’' This was in B.C. 378, when he was joined with
Timotheus and Callistratus in the command os the forces which
were dispatched to the aid of Thebes against Agesilaus.—Boeot2·2's
subsidio. ‘⁴ To the aid os the Bceotians.” (Zumpt, ᾧ 422.)

Victoria fidente. “Being confident of victory.” With fido, the
thing which produces the confidence is put more frequently in the
ablative than in the dative. (Zumpt, §4l3.)—Summo duce. The ep-

“The hired troops,⁷' i. c.‚ the mercenary forces—Reliquam phalan-
gem, διο. For reliquum exercitum, &c. The term phalanx (φάλαγξ),
strictly speaking, has reference to the Greek mode of drawing up
infantry in a close, compact mass—Vetuit. Referring to Chabrias.
—Obnixoque genu. scuto, ἀρ. “And he taught them to receive the
attack os the soe, the knee being bent firmly against the shield, and
the spear being held out,'’ i. ε., with their shield testing against one
knee, and their spears pointed at tlie enemy. In this position the ’
left soot would be advanced‚ the lest knee bent in frent, and the
shIeld would be held in sront of the bended knee, with the latter
acting as a support sor it srom behind. As the upper part os the
body would naturally be bent sorward, the whole person would thus
be protected from the helmet downward, while the levelled spear
would prevent any near approach—Id noi-um contuens. ‘⁴ Looking
with surprise at this as something nexv,” i. c.. surpriscd at this novel
arrangement. Observe that novum is here the predicate osthe ob-
ject. Contucri is much stronger than intueri, and means. “to re-
gaid any thing with fixed attention, with surpi·ise,'' &c—-Incicrrcn-

ece. “When rushing on.‘’ N

Conon cum parte navium, &c. This was in ΒΕ. 393, after Phar-
nabazus and Conon had sailed to the coast of Laconia, and made
descents on various parts os it, inflicting all the damage in their
power. They then proceeded to the isthmus, and Pharnabazus,
aster exhorting the deputies of the allied states whom he found
there to carry on the war with vigor, was preparing to return home,
when Conon requested that the fleet might be placed at his disposal‚
promising to maintain it at the expense of the islanders of the
AEgean. And he proposed, in the first instance, to employ it.in a
work which, as he represented to the satrap, would be selt by
Sparta as one os the deepest wounds she could suffer. It was to
restore the long walls of Athens and the fortifications os the Piraee-
us. Pharnabazus eagerly assented‚ and not only granted Conon’s
request‚ but surnished him with money sor the undertaking. Conon
immediately sailed to Athens, and restored a great part os the walls
by the labor os his crews‚ and of workmen hired with the Persian
gold. The rest was completed by the Athenians themselves, with
the aid of their allies, more especially the Thebans. (Thirlwall,
Hist. Gr„ c. xxxvi.)—Civibus suis donat. It would have been more

correct to say that he expended this sum on the rebuilding os the
long walls, dcc.

Neque tamen ea non pia, ἀεὶ. “ Nor yet were these things not ex-
pressive os his duty to his country, and deserving oscommendation.”
The term pius is one os extensive application‚ and comprehends the
discharge of what is due to relations, to country, and to the gods.
